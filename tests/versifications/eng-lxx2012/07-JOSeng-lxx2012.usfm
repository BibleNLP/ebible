\v 1 And it came to pass after the death of Moses, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Naue, the minister of Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Moses my servant is dead; now then arise, go over Jordan, you and all this people, into the land, which I give them. 
\v 3 Every spot on which you⌃ shall tread I will give it to you, as I said to Moses. 
\v 4 The wilderness and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the \f + \fr 1:4  \fl Or, \ft last, \fl or, \ft farthest sea. \f* extremity of the sea; your coasts shall be from the setting of the sun. 
\v 5 Not a man shall stand against you all the days of your life; and as I was with Moses, so will I also be with you, and \x + \xo 1:5  \xt Heb 13:5 \x* I will not fail you, or neglect you. 
\v 6 Be strong and quit yourself like a man, for you shall divide the land to this people, which I swore to give to \f + \fr 1:6  \fl Gr. \ft to your fathers, to give them. \f* your fathers. 
\v 7 Be strong, therefore, and quit yourself like a man, to observe and do as Moses my servant commanded you; and you shall not turn \f + \fr 1:7  \fl Gr. \ft from them, \fl sc. \ft the commands. \f* therefrom to the right hand or to the left, that you may be wise in whatever you may do. 
\v 8 And the book of this law shall not depart out of your mouth, and you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may know how to do all the things that are written \add in it\add*; then shall you prosper, and make your ways prosperous, and then shall you be wise. 
\v 9 Behold! I have commanded you; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord your God is with you in all places whither you go. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying, 
\v 11 Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and you⌃ \f + \fr 1:11  \fl Gr. \ft do go over. \f* shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you. 
\v 12 And to Ruben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse, Joshua said, 
\v 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, the Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land. 
\v 14 Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and you⌃ shall go over \f + \fr 1:14  \fl Or, \ft in good order. \f* well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and you⌃ shall fight on their side; 
\v 15 until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then you⌃ shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward. 
\v 16 And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which you command us, and we will go to every place whither you shall send us. 
\v 17 Whereinsoever we listened to Moses we will listen to you; only let the Lord our God be with you, as he was with Moses. 
\v 18 And whoever shall disobey you, and whoever shall not listen to your words as you shall command him, let him die; but be you strong and courageous.

\v 1 And Joshua the son of Naue sent out of Sattin two young men to spy \add the land\add*, saying, Go up and view the land and Jericho: and the two young men went and entered into Jericho; and they entered into the house of a harlot, whose name \add was\add* Raab, and lodged there. 
\v 2 And it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, Men of the sons of Israel have come in hither to spy the land. 
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent and spoke to Raab, saying, Bring out the men that entered into your house this night; for they are come to spy out the land. 
\v 4 And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she spoke to \f + \fr 2:4  \fl Gr. \ft them. \f* the messengers, saying, The men came in to me, 
\v 5 but when the gate was shut in the \f + \fr 2:5  \fl Gr. \ft dark. \f* evening, the men went out; I know not whither they are gone: follow after them, if you⌃ \f + \fr 2:5  \fl Gr. \ft shall. \f* may overtake them. 
\v 6 But she \add had\add* brought them up upon the house, and hid them in the flax-stalks that were spread by her on the house. 
\v 7 And the men followed after them in the way to Jordan to the fords; and the gate was shut. 
\v 8 And it came to pass when the men who pursued after them were gone forth, and before the spies had lain down to sleep, that she came up to them on the top of the house; 
\v 9 and she said to them, I know that the Lord has given you the land; for the fear of you has fallen upon us. 
\v 10 For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when you⌃ came out of the land of Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom you⌃ utterly destroyed. 
\v 11 And when we heard it we were amazed in our heart, and there was no longer any spirit in any of us because of you, for the Lord your god \add is\add* God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath. 
\v 12 And now swear to me by the Lord God; since I deal mercifully with you, so do you⌃ also deal mercifully with the house of my father: 
\v 13 and save alive the house of my father, my mother, and my brethren, and all my house, and all that they have, and you⌃ shall rescue my soul from death. 
\v 14 And the men said to her, Our life for yours \add even\add* to death: and she said, When the Lord shall have delivered the city to you, you⌃ shall deal mercifully and truly with me. 
\v 15 And she let them down by the window; 
\v 16 and she said to them, Depart into the hill-country, lest the pursuers meet you, and you⌃ shall be hidden there three days until your pursuers return from after you, and afterwards you⌃ shall depart on your way. 
\v 17 And the men said to her, We are clear of this your oath. 
\v 18 Behold, \f + \fr 2:18  \fl Gr. \ft do enter. \f* we shall enter into a part of the city, and you shall set \f + \fr 2:18  \fl Gr. \ft the sign. \f* a sign; you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window, by which you have let us down, and you shall bring in to yourself, into your house, your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all the family of your father. 
\v 19 And it shall come to pass that whoever shall go outside the door of your house, his guilt shall be upon him, and we shall be quit of this your oath; and we will be responsible for all that shall be found with you in your house. 
\v 20 But if any one should injure us, or betray these our matters, we shall be quit of this your oath. 
\v 21 And she said to them, Let it be according to your word; and she sent them out, and they departed. 
\v 22 And they came to the hill-country, and remained there three days; and the pursuers searched all the roads, and found them not. 
\v 23 And the two young men returned, and came down out of the mountain; and they went over to Joshua the son of Naue, and told him all things that had happened to them. 
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, The Lord has delivered all the land into our power, and all the inhabitants of that land tremble because of us. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Sattin; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over. 
\v 2 And it came to pass after three days, \add that\add* the scribes went through the camp; 
\v 3 and they charged the people, saying, When you⌃ shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, you⌃ shall depart from your places, and you⌃ shall go after it. 
\v 4 But let there be a distance between you and it; you⌃ shall stand as much as two thousand cubits \add from it\add*. Do not draw near to it, that you⌃ may know the way which you⌃ are to go; for you⌃ have not gone the way \f + \fr 3:4  \fl Gr. \ft from yesterday and the third day. A frequent Hebraism. \f* before. 
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you. 
\v 6 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people. 
\v 7 And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt you before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with you. 
\v 8 And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as you⌃ shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then you⌃ shall stand in Jordan. 
\v 9 And Joshua said to the children of Israel, \f + \fr 3:9  \fl Gr. \ft bring hither. \fl sc. \ft yourselves. \f* Come hither, and listen to the word of the Lord our God. 
\v 10 Hereby you⌃ shall know that the living God \add is\add* among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Chananite, and the Chettite and Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan. 
\v 12 Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan \add below\add* shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop. 
\v 14 And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people. 
\v 15 And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan; (now Jordan \f + \fr 3:15  \fl Gr. \ft its whole channel. \f* overflowed all its banks \f + \fr 3:15  \fl Gr. \ft as on the days. \f* about the time of wheat harvest:) 
\v 16 then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as \f + \fr 3:16  \fl Gr. \ft a part. \f* the region of Kariathiarim, and \f + \fr 3:16  \fl Gr. \ft that which came down. \f* the lower part came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho. 
\v 17 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry land in the midst of Jordan; and all the children of Israel went through on dry land, until all the people had completely gone over Jordan. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 2 Take men from the people, one of each tribe, 
\v 3 and charge them; and you⌃ shall take out of the midst of Jordan twelve \f + \fr 4:3  \fl Gr. \ft ready. \fqa Heb. הכיך. \fl A.V. firm, \fqa applied to the foot of the priests. \f* fit stones, and having carried them across together with yourselves, place them in your camp, where you⌃ shall encamp for the night. 
\v 4 And Joshua having called twelve men \f + \fr 4:4  \fl Gr. \ft of the distinguished, or, illustrious. \f* of distinction among the children of Israel, one of each tribe, 
\v 5 said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel: 
\v 6 that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when your son asks you \f + \fr 4:6  \fl Gr. \ft of the distinguished, or, illustrious. \f* in future, saying, What are these stones to us? 
\v 7 then you may explain to your son, saying, The river Jordan was \f + \fr 4:7  \fl Gr. \ft failed. \f* dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel for ever. 
\v 8 And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over,) and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there. 
\v 9 And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day. 
\v 10 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua \add had\add* finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hasted and passed over. 
\v 11 And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them. 
\v 12 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse passed over \f + \fr 4:12  \fl Or, \ft equipped. \f* armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them. 
\v 13 Forty thousand \f + \fr 4:13  \fl Gr. \ft in good order. \f* armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho. 
\v 14 In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as \add they did\add* Moses, as long as he lived. 
\v 15 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 16 Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan. 
\v 17 And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan. 
\v 18 And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land, \add that\add* the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks. 
\v 19 And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Galgala in the region eastward from Jericho. 
\v 20 And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Galgala, 
\v 21 saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones? 
\v 22 Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land, 
\v 23 when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over. 
\v 24 That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that you⌃ might worship the Lord our God in every work. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and \f + \fr 5:1  \fl Gr. \ft their minds or thoughts melted. \f* they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them \f + \fr 5:1  \fl Gr. \ft from the face of. \f* because of the children of Israel. 
\v 2 And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make you stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time. 
\v 3 And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the “Hill of Foreskins.” 
\v 4 And \add this is\add* the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt, 
\v 5 all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wondered in the wilderness of Mabdaris— 
\v 6 Therefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord swore to give to their fathers, \add even\add* a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 7 And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way. 
\v 8 And when they had been circumcised they rested \f + \fr 5:8  \fl Gr. \ft sitting. A frequent Hebraism. \f* continuing there in the camp till they were healed. 
\v 9 And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Naue, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Galgala. 
\v 10 And the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain. 
\v 11 And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new \add corn\add*. 
\v 12 In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna: and they took the fruits of the land of the Phoenicians in that year. 
\v 13 And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and \add there was\add* a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Are you for us or on the side of our enemies? 
\v 14 And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord. 
\v 15 And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what command you your servant? 
\v 16 And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe off your feet, for the place whereon you now stand is holy. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho was closely shut up and besieged, and none went out of it, and none came in. 
\v 2 And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver Jericho into your power, and its king in it, \f + \fr 6:2  \fl Gr. \ft mighty in strength. \f* \add and its\add* mighty men. 
\v 3 And do you set the men of war round about it. 
\v 4 And it shall be \add that\add* when you⌃ shall sound with the trumpet, \f + \fr 6:4  \fl Gr. \ft let all the people, etc. \f* all the people shall shout together. 
\v 5 And when they have shouted, the walls of the city shall fall \f + \fr 6:5  \fl Or, \ft of their own accord. \f* of themselves; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing direct into the city. 
\v 6 And Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue went in to the priests, and spoke to them, saying, 
\v 7 And let seven priests having seven \f + \fr 6:7  \fqa Heb. שופרוה היוכליס \fl A.V. \ft 'ram's horns.' Only in this place. \f* sacred trumpets proceed thus before the Lord, and let them sound loudly; and let the ark of the covenant of the Lord follow. 
\v 8 Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord. 
\v 9 And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord \add proceed\add* sounding the trumpets. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let any one hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the \f + \fr 6:10  \fl Gr. \ft day. \f* time to cry out, and then you⌃ shall cry out. 
\v 11 And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there. 
\v 12 And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 
\v 13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterwards the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
\v 14 And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days. 
\v 15 And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city. 
\v 17 And the city shall be \f + \fr 6:17  \fl Or, \ft an accursed thing. \f* devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do you⌃ save Raab the harlot, and all things in her house. 
\v 18 But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest you⌃ set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and you⌃ make the camp of the children of Israel an accursed thing, and destroy us. 
\v 19 And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord. 
\v 20 And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city: 
\v 21 and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the \f + \fr 6:21  \fl Gr. \ft mouth. \f* edge of the sword. 
\v 22 And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted a spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has. 
\v 23 And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Raab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel. 
\v 24 And the city was burnt with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord. 
\v 25 And Joshua saved alive Raab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
\v 26 And Joshua adjured \add them\add* on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his firstborn, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Baethel; he laid the foundation in Abiron his firstborn, and set up the gates of it in his youngest \f + \fr 6:26  \fl Gr. \ft saved. \f* surviving son. 
\v 27 And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel committed a great trespass, and purloined \add part\add* of the accursed thing; and Achar the son of Charmi, the son of Zambri, the son of Zara, of the tribe of Juda, took of the accursed thing; and the Lord was very angry with the children of Israel. 
\v 2 And Joshua sent men to Gai, which is by Baethel, saying, Spy out Gai: and the men went up and spied Gai. 
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege: carry not up there the whole people, for \add the enemy\add* are few. 
\v 4 And there went up about three thousand men, and they fled from before the men of Gai. 
\v 5 And the men of Gai killed of them to the number of thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate, and destroyed them from the steep hill; and the heart of the people was alarmed and became as water. 
\v 6 And Joshua tore his garments; and Joshua fell on the earth on his face before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they cast dust on their heads. 
\v 7 And Joshua said, I pray, Lord, therefore has your servant brought this people over Jordan to deliver them to the Amorite to destroy us? \f + \fr 7:7  \fl Gr. \ft and if we had. \f* would we had remained and settled ourselves beyond Jordan. 
\v 8 And what shall I say since Israel has turned his \f + \fr 7:8  \fl Gr. \ft neck. \fqa Heb. שף the back of the neck. \f* back before his enemy? 
\v 9 And when the Chananite and all the inhabitants of the land hear it, they shall compass us round and destroy us from off the land: and what will you do \add for\add* your great name? 
\v 10 And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why have you fallen upon your face? 
\v 11 The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless you⌃ remove the cursed thing from yourselves. 
\v 13 Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; you⌃ shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until you⌃ shall have removed the cursed thing from among you. 
\v 14 And you⌃ shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall show, you⌃ shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall show, you⌃ shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall show, you⌃ shall bring man by man. 
\v 15 And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burnt with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel. 
\v 16 And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Juda was pointed out. 
\v 17 And it was brought by their families, and family of the Zaraites was pointed out. 
\v 18 And it was brought man by man, and Achar the son of Zambri the son of Zara was pointed out. 
\v 19 And Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what you have done, and hide it not from me. 
\v 20 And Achar answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done: 
\v 21 I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachmas of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachmas, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in my tent, and the silver is hid under them. 
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them. 
\v 23 And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord. 
\v 24 And Joshua took Achar the son of Zara, and brought him to the valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people \add were\add* with him; and he brought them to \f + \fr 7:24  \fqa Heb. צמק צכור valley of trouble. \f* Emec Achor. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to Achar, Why have you destroyed us? the Lord destroy you \f + \fr 7:25  \fl Gr. \ft as also today. \f* as at this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones. 
\v 26 And they set up over him a great heap of stones; and the Lord ceased from his fierce anger. Therefore he called \f + \fr 7:26  \fl Gr. \ft it. \f* the place Emecachor until this day. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be timorous: take with you all the men of war, and arise, go up to Gai; behold, I have given into your hands the king of Gai, and his land. 
\v 2 And you shall do to Gai, as you did to Jericho and its king; and you shall take to yourself the spoil of its cattle; set now for yourself an ambush for the city behind. 
\v 3 And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Gai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night. 
\v 4 And he charged them, saying, Do you⌃ lie in ambush behind the city: do not go far from the city, and you⌃ shall all be ready. 
\v 5 And I and all with me will draw near to the city: and it shall come to pass when the inhabitants of Gai shall come forth to meet us, as before, that we will flee from before them. 
\v 6 And when they shall come out after us, we will draw them away from the city; and they will say, These men flee from before us, as also before. 
\v 7 And you⌃ shall rise up out of the ambuscade, and go into the city. 
\v 8 You⌃ shall do according to this word, behold! I have commanded you. 
\v 9 And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Baethel and Gai, westward of Gai. 
\v 10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and \f + \fr 8:10  \fl Gr. \ft reviewed. \f* numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Gai. 
\v 11 And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward. 
\v 12-13 And the ambuscade \add was\add* on the west side of the city. 
\v 14 And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw \add it\add*, he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people \add that were\add* with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade \add formed\add* against him behind the city. 
\v 15 And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them. 
\v 16 And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city. 
\v 17 There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
\v 18 And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth your hand with the spear that is in your hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into your hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place. 
\v 19 And Joshua stretched out his hand \add and\add* his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and \f + \fr 8:19  \fl Or, \ft set it on fire. \f* burnt the city with fire. 
\v 20 And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way. 
\v 21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade \f + \fr 8:21  \fl Gr. \ft took. \f* had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and struck the men of Gai. 
\v 22 And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some \add being\add* on this side, and some on that; and they struck them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped. 
\v 23 And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
\v 24 And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them \add even\add* to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25-26 And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: \add they killed\add* all the inhabitants of Gai. 
\v 27 Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua. 
\v 28 And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever, \add even\add* to this day. 
\v 29 And he hanged the king of Gai on a \f + \fr 8:29  \fl Gr. \ft double tree. \f* gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into \f + \fr 8:29  \fl Gr. \ft the pit or trench. For vv. 30-35, see chap. 8:2. \f* a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day. 
\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gaebal, 
\v 31 as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron \f + \fr 8:31  \fl Gr. \ft was not lifted up. \f* had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a peace-offering. 
\v 32 And Joshua wrote upon the stones \f + \fr 8:32  \fl Or, \ft a Deuteronomy. \f* a copy of the law, even the law of Moses, before the children of Israel. 
\v 33 And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount Gaebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people. 
\v 34 And afterwards Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses. 
\v 35 There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel.

\v 6 And they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel to Galgala, and said to Joshua and Israel, We are come from a far land: now then make a covenant with us. 
\v 7 And the children of Israel said to the Chorrhaean, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how should I make a covenant with you? 
\v 8 And they said to Joshua, We are your servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are you⌃, and whence have you⌃ come? 
\v 9 And they said, Your servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord your God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt, 
\v 10 and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, who lived in Astaroth and in Edrain. 
\v 11 And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and you⌃ shall say to them, We are your servants, and now make a covenant with us.

\v 14 And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not \add counsel of\add* the Lord.

\v 17 And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities \add were\add* Gabaon, and Kephira, and Berot, and the cities of Jarin. 
\v 18 And the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes swore to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes. 
\v 19 And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them. 
\v 20 This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them. 
\v 21 They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them. 
\v 22 And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have you⌃ deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas you⌃ are fellow-countrymen of those who dwell among us? 
\v 23 And now you⌃ are cursed: there shall not fail of you a slave, or a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water to me and my God. 
\v 24 And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord your God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that lived on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives \f + \fr 9:24  \fl Gr. \ft from before you. \f* because of you, and \add therefore\add* we did this thing.

\v 26 And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not kill them. 
\v 27-29 And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose. \f + \fr 9:27-29  \ft The following verses are additions to Brenton's text from the alexandrine codex.

\v 1 And when Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Gai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Gai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had gone over to Joshua and Israel; 
\v 2 then they were greatly terrified by them, for \add the king\add* knew that Gabaon \add was\add* a great city, as one of the \f + \fr 10:2  \fl Gr. \ft mother-cities. \f* chief cities, and all its men \add were\add* mighty. 
\v 3 So Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Phidon king of Jerimuth, and to Jephtha king of Lachis, and to Dabin king of Odollam, saying, 
\v 4 Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gabaon; for the \f + \fr 10:4  \fl Gr. \ft they. \f* Gabaonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gabaon, and besieged it. 
\v 6 And the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Joshua into the camp to Galgala, saying, Slack not your hands from your servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us. 
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Galgala, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength. 
\v 8 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into your hands; there shall not one of them be left before you. 
\v 9 And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he \add had\add* advanced all the night out of Galgala. 
\v 10 And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gabaon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Oronin, and they struck them to Azeca and to Makeda. 
\v 11 And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Oronin, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azeca; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel killed with the sword in the battle. 
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gabaon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said, Let the sun stand over against Gabaon, and the moon over against the valley of Aelon. 
\v 13 And the sun and the moon stood still, until God executed vengeance on their enemies; and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of \f + \fr 10:13  \fl i.e. \ft additional day without a night between. \f* one day. 
\v 14-15 And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should listen to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel. 
\v 16 And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makeda. 
\v 17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hid in the cave that is in Makeda. 
\v 18 And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them. 
\v 19 But do not you⌃ stand, but pursue after your enemies, and \f + \fr 10:19  \fl Gr. \ft fasten upon or seize. \f* attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands. 
\v 20 And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities. 
\v 21 And all the people returned \f + \fr 10:21  \fl Gr. \ft sound, or healthy. \f* safe to Joshua to Makeda; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue. 
\v 22 And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave. 
\v 23 And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam. 
\v 24 And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs \f + \fr 10:24  \fl Gr. \ft of the war. \f* of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom you⌃ fight. 
\v 26 And Joshua killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening. 
\v 27 And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they \add had\add* fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave, \add which remain\add* till this day. 
\v 28 And they took Makeda on that day, and killed \f + \fr 10:28  \fl Gr. \ft it. \f* the inhabitants with the \f + \fr 10:28  \fl Gr. \ft mouth. \f* edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makeda, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\v 29 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makeda to Lebna, and besieged Lebna. 
\v 30 And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and killed the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and every thing breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\v 31 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lebna to Lachis, and he encamped about it, and besieged it. 
\v 32 And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel; and \f + \fr 10:32  \fl Gr. \ft he, \fl i.e. \ft Israel. \f* they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Lebna. 
\v 33 Then Elam the king of Gazer went up to help Lachis; and Joshua struck him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped. 
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachis to Odollam, and he besieged it and \f + \fr 10:34  \fl Or, \ft vigourously attacked it. \f* took it. 
\v 35 And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and killed the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and killed every thing breathing in it, as they did to Lachis. 
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Chebron, and encamped about it. 
\v 37 And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the living creatures that were in it; there was no one preserved: they destroyed it and all things in it, as they did to Odollam. 
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel returned to Dabir; and they encamped about it; 
\v 39 and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and every thing breathing in it; and they did not leave in it any one that was preserved: as they did to Chebron and her king, so they did to Dabir and her king. 
\v 40 And Joshua struck all the land of the hill country, and \f + \fr 10:40  \fl Heb. \ft south. \f* Nageb and the plain country, and Asedoth, and her kings, they did not leave of them one that was saved: and they utterly destroyed every thing that had the breath of life, as the Lord God of Israel commanded,

\v 4 And they and their kings with them went forth, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses, and very many chariots. 
\v 5 And all the kings assembled in person, and came to the same place, and encamped at the waters of Maron to war with Israel. 
\v 6 And the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for to-morrow \add at\add* this time I will put them to flight before Israel: you shall hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire 
\v 7 And Joshua and all the men of war came upon them \f + \fr 11:7  \fl Gr. \ft to. \f* at the water of Maron suddenly; and they attacked them in the hill country. 
\v 8 And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they struck them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Maseron, and to the plains of Massoch eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived. 
\v 9 And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire. 
\v 10 And Joshua returned at that time, and took Asor and her king; now Asor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms. 
\v 11 And they killed with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burnt Asor with fire. 
\v 12 And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and killed them with the edge of the sword; and utterly killed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. 
\v 13 But all the walled cities Israel burnt not; but Israel burnt Asor only. 
\v 14 And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they killed all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing. 
\v 15 As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him. 
\v 16 And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Nageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain; 
\v 17 from the mountain of Chelcha, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Balagad, and the plains of Libanus, under mount Aermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and killed them. 
\v 18 And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings. 
\v 19 And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war. 
\v 20 For it was of the Lord to \f + \fr 11:20  \fl Gr. \ft strengthen. \f* harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses.

\v 2 They inherited according to their lots, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Joshua to the nine tribes and the half tribe, on the other side of Jordan. 
\v 3 But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
\v 4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasse and Ephraim; and there was none inheritance in the land given to the Levites, only cities to dwell in, and their suburbs separated for the cattle, and their cattle. 
\v 5 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel; and they divided the land. 
\v 6 And the children of Juda came to Joshua in Galgal, and Chaleb the \add son\add* of Jephone the Kenezite said to him, You know the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Cades Barne. 
\v 7 For I was forty years old when Moses the servant of God sent me out of Cades Barne to spy out the land; and I returned him an answer according to his mind. 
\v 8 My brethren that went up with me turned away the heart of the people, but I \f + \fr 14:8  \fl Or, \ft according to the Heb. idiom, 'fully followed.' \f* applied my self to follow the Lord my God. 
\v 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, The land on which you are gone up, it shall be your inheritance and your children's for ever, because you have applied yourself to follow the Lord our God. 
\v 10 And now the Lord has kept me alive as he said: this \add is\add* the forty-fifth year since the Lord spoke that word to Moses; and Israel journeyed in the wilderness; and now, behold, I \add am\add* this day eighty-five years old. 
\v 11 I am still strong this day, as when the Lord sent me: just so strong am I now to go out and to come in for war. 
\v 12 And now I ask of you this mountain, as the Lord said in that day; for you heard this word on that day; and now the Enakim are there, cities great and strong: if then the Lord should be with me, I will utterly destroy them, as the Lord said to me. 
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Chebron to Chaleb the son of Jephone the son of Kenez for an inheritance. 
\v 14 Therefore Chebron became the inheritance of Chaleb the \add son\add* of Jephone the Kenezite until this day, because he followed the commandment of the Lord God of Israel.

\v 14 And Chaleb the son of Jephone destroyed thence the three sons of Enac, Susi, and Tholami, and Achima. 
\v 15 And Chaleb went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; and the name of Dabir before was \f + \fr 15:15  \fqa Heb. Kirjath-sepher. \f* the city of Letters. 
\v 16 And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall take and destroy the city of Letters, and master it, to him will I give my daughter Ascha to wife. 
\v 17 And Gothoniel the son of Chenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and he gave him Ascha his daughter to wife. 
\v 18 And it came to pass as she went out that she counselled him, saying, I will ask of my father a field; and she cried from off her ass; and Chaleb said to her, \f + \fr 15:18  \ft What has you to say? \+add or \+add* of what have you need? \f* What is it?

\v 40 And the seventh lot came out to Dan. 
\v 41 And their borders were Sarath, and Asa, and the cities of Sammaus,

\v 47 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan, according to their families, these \add are\add* their cities and their villages: and the children of Dan did not drive out the Amorite who afflicted them in the mountain; and the Amorite would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but they forcibly took from them the border of their portion. 
\v 48 And the sons of Dan went and fought against Lachis, and took it, and struck it with the \f + \fr 19:48  \fl Gr. \ft mouth. \f* edge of the sword; and they lived in it, and called the name of it Lasendan: and the Amorite continued to dwell in Edom and in Salamin: and the hand of Ephraim prevailed against them, and they became tribute to them. 
\v 49 And they proceeded to take possession of the land according to their borders, and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Naue among them, 
\v 50 by the command of God, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Thamnasarach, which is in the mount of Ephraim; and he built the city, and lived in it. 
\v 51 These \add are\add* the divisions which Eleazar the priest divided by lot, and Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue, and the heads of families among the tribes of Israel, according to the lots, in Selo before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and they \f + \fr 19:51  \fqa Heb. finished dividing.

\v 1 And the heads of the families of the sons of Levi drew near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue, and to the heads of families of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 2 And they spoke to them in Selo in the land of Chanaan, saying, The Lord gave commandment by \f + \fr 21:2  \fl Gr. \ft the hand of Moses. \f* Moses to give us cities to dwell in, and the country round about for our cattle. 
\v 3 So the children of Israel gave to the Levites in their inheritance by the command of the Lord the cities and the country round. 
\v 4 And the lot came out for the children of Caath; and the sons of Aaron, the priests the Levites, had by lot thirteen cities \f + \fr 21:4  \fl Gr. \ft from. \f* out of the tribe of Juda, and out of the tribe of Symeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

\v 9 And the tribe of the children of Juda, and the tribe of the children of Symeon, and \add part\add* of the tribe of the children of Benjamin gave these cities, and they were assigned

\v 41 So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and lived in it. 
\v 42 And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he swore to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands. 
\v 43 There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass.

\v 1 Then Joshua called together the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, 
\v 2 and said to them, You⌃ have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and you⌃ have listened to my voice in all that he commanded you. 
\v 3 You⌃ have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day you⌃ have kept the commandment of the Lord your God. 
\v 4 And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan. 
\v 5 But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul. 
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes. 
\v 7 And to \add one\add* half the tribe of Manasse Moses gave a portion in the land of Basan, and to \add the other\add* half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them. 
\v 8 And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment. 
\v 9 So the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, departed from the children of Israel in Selo in the land of Chanaan, to go away into Galaad, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 
\v 10 And they came to Galaad of Jordan, which is in the land of Chanaan: and the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at. 
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse have built an altar at the borders of the land of Chanaan at Galaad of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel. 
\v 12 And all the children of Israel gathered together to Selo, so as to go up and fight against them. 
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad, both Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 
\v 14 and ten of the chiefs with him; \add there was\add* one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel; (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel.) 
\v 15 And they came to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the \f + \fr 22:15  \fl Gr. \ft halves, \fl adj. q.d. \ft dimidios \fl viros\f* half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad; and they spoke to them, saying, 
\v 16 Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, What \add is\add* this transgression that you⌃ have transgressed before the God of Israel, to turn away today from the Lord, in that you⌃ have built for yourselves an altar, so that you⌃ should be apostates from the Lord? 
\v 17 Is the sin of Phogor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 18 And you⌃ have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if you⌃ revolt this day from the Lord, that to-morrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel. 
\v 19 And now if the land of your possession \add be too\add* little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive you⌃ an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do you⌃ apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God. 
\v 20 Behold! did not Achar the \add son\add* of Zara commit a trespass \add taking\add* of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin. 
\v 21 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying, 
\v 22 God \add even\add* God is the Lord, and God \add even\add* God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day. 
\v 23 And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole burnt offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering, —the Lord shall require it. 
\v 24 But we have done this for the sake of precaution \add concerning this\add* thing, saying, Lest \f + \fr 22:24  \fl Gr. \ft to-morrow. \f* hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have you⌃ to do with the Lord God of Israel? 
\v 25 Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and you⌃ have no portion \f + \fr 22:25  \fl Gr. \ft of. \f* in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord. 
\v 26 And we \f + \fr 22:26  \fl Gr. \ft spoke. \f* gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt offerings, nor for meat-offerings; 
\v 27 but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, You⌃ have no portion in the Lord. 
\v 28 And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak \add so\add* to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons. 
\v 29 Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt offerings, and for \f + \fr 22:29  \ft A double translation in Greek. \f* peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle. 
\v 30 And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him \f + \fr 22:30  \fl Gr. \ft having heard. \f* heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them. 
\v 31 And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord \add is\add* with us, because you⌃ have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because you⌃ have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
\v 32 So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them. 
\v 33 And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against \f + \fr 22:33  \fl Gr. \ft them. \f* the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they lived upon it. 
\v 34 And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in \f + \fr 23:1  \fl Gr. \ft days. \f* years. 
\v 2 And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years. 
\v 3 And you⌃ have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us; \add for it\add* is the Lord your God who has fought for you. 
\v 4 See, that I have \f + \fr 23:4  \fl Gr. \ft cast upon you. \f* given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and \add some\add* I have destroyed; and \f + \fr 23:4  \fl Gr. \ft he shall bound. \f* the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward. 
\v 5 And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and you⌃ shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you. 
\v 6 Do you⌃ therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that you⌃ turn not to the right hand or to the left; 
\v 7 that you⌃ go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall you⌃ serve them, neither shall you⌃ bow down to them. 
\v 8 But you⌃ shall cleave to the Lord our God, as you⌃ have done until this day. 
\v 9 And the Lord shall destroy them before you, \add even\add* great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day. 
\v 10 One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to us. 
\v 11 And take you⌃ great heed to love the Lord our God. 
\v 12 For if you⌃ shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you, 
\v 13 know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until you⌃ be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you. 
\v 14 But I hasten to go the way \add of death\add*, as all that are upon the earth also \add do\add*: and you⌃ know in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen \add to the ground\add* of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you, 
\v 16 when you⌃ transgress the covenant of the Lord our God, which he has charged us, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them.

\p
\v 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribe of Israel to Selo, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God. 
\v 2 And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, \add even\add* Thara, the father of Abraam and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods. 
\v 3 And I took your father Abraam from the other side of the river, and I guided him \f + \fr 24:3  \fl Gr. \ft in. \f* through all the land, and I multiplied his seed; 
\v 4 and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them. 
\v 5 And I struck Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them. 
\v 6 And afterwards \add God\add* brought out our fathers from Egypt, and you⌃ entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea. 
\v 7 And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he \f + \fr 24:7  \fl Gr. \ft gave. \f* put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and you⌃ were in the wilderness many days. 
\v 8 And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that lived beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and you⌃ inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you. 
\v 9 And Balac, king of Moab, son of Sepphor, rose up, and \f + \fr 24:9  \fl Gr. \ft set himself in array. \f* made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us. 
\v 10 But the Lord your God would not destroy you; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them \add to us\add*. 
\v 11 And you⌃ crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Chettite, and the Gergesite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands. 
\v 12 And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, \add even\add* twelve kings of the Amorites, not with your sword, nor with your bow. 
\v 13 And he gave you a land on which you⌃ did not labor, and cities which you⌃ did not build, and you⌃ were settled in them; and you⌃ \f + \fr 24:13  \fl Or, \ft shall eat. \f* eat \add of\add* vineyards and olive yards which you⌃ did not plant. 
\v 14 And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord. 
\v 15 But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom you⌃ will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom you⌃ dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy. 
\v 16 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods. 
\v 17 The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations \f + \fr 24:17  \fl Gr. \ft whom we passed through them. \fl Hebraism \ft See Mark 1:7; Luke 3:16; 1 Pet 2:24. \f* through whom we passed. 
\v 18 And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yes, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God. 
\v 19 And Joshua said to the people, Indeed you⌃ will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions. 
\v 20 Whenever you⌃ shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, \f + \fr 24:20  \fl Or, \ft whereas on the contrary. \f* because he has done you good. 
\v 21 And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord. 
\v 22 And Joshua said to the people, You⌃ \add are\add* witnesses against yourselves, that you⌃ have chosen the Lord to serve him. 
\v 23 And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 24 And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will listen to his voice. 
\v 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel. 
\v 26 And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the \f + \fr 24:26  \fl Gr. \ft Properly a pine or turpentine tree. So chap. 17:9. \f* oak before the Lord. 
\v 27 And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this \add stone\add* shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever you⌃ shall deal falsely with the Lord my God. 
\v 28 And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place. 
\v 29 And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died, \add at the age\add* of one hundred and ten years. 
\v 30 And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad: there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day. 
\v 31 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that \f + \fr 24:31  \fl Gr. \ft drew out the time with Joshua. \fl Hebraism.\f* lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel. 
\v 32 And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried \add them\add* in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who lived in Sicima for one hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion. 
\v 33 And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gabaar of Phinees his son, which he gave him in mount Ephraim. In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar: but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.
