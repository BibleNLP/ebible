\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and sent them out of the camp: as the Lord said to Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Every man or woman who shall commit any sin that is common to man, or if that soul shall in anyway have neglected the commandment and transgressed; 
\v 7  \add that person\add* shall confess the sin which he has committed, and shall make satisfaction for his trespass: he \add shall pay\add* the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part, and shall make restoration to him against whom he has trespassed. 
\v 8 But if a man have no near kinsman, so as to make satisfaction for his trespass to him, the trespass-offering paid to the Lord shall be for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which he shall make atonement with it for him. 
\v 9 And every first fruits in all the sanctified things among the children of Israel, whatever they shall offer to the Lord, shall be for the priest himself. 
\v 10 And the hallowed things of every man shall be his; and whatever man shall give \add any thing\add* to the priest, the gift shall be his. 
\v 11 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 12 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, Whosesoever wife shall transgress against him, and slight and despise him, 
\v 13 and \add supposing\add* any one shall lie with her carnally, and the thing shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and she should conceal it and be herself defiled, and there be no witness with her, and she should not be taken; 
\v 14 and there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; or there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous of his wife, and she should not be defiled; 
\v 15 then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring his gift for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal: he shall not pour oil upon it, neither shall he put frankincense upon it; for it is a sacrifice of jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, recalling sin to remembrance. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring her, and cause her to stand before the Lord. 
\v 17 And the priest shall take pure running water in an earthen vessel, and he shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle of witness, and the priest having taken it shall cast it into the water. 
\v 18 And the priest shall cause the woman to stand before the Lord, and shall uncover the head of the woman, and shall put into her hands the sacrifice of memorial, the sacrifice of jealousy; and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of this conviction that brings the curse. 
\v 19 And the priest shall adjure her, and shall say to the woman, If no one has lain with you, and if you have not transgressed so as to be polluted, being under the power of your husband, be free from this water of the conviction that causes the curse. 
\v 20 But if being a married woman you have transgressed, or been polluted, and any one has lain with you, beside your husband: 
\v 21 then the priest shall adjure the woman by the oaths of this curse, and the priest shall say to the woman, The Lord bring you into a curse and under an oath in the midst of your people, in that the Lord should cause your thigh to rot and your belly to swell; 
\v 22 and this water bringing the curse shall enter into your womb to cause your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot. And the woman shall say, So be it, So be it. 
\v 23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall blot them out \f + \fr 5:23  \fl Gr. \ft in. \f* with the water of the conviction that brings the curse. 
\v 24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the water of the conviction that brings the curse; and the water of the conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her. 
\v 25 And the priest shall take from the hand of the woman the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall present the sacrifice before the Lord, and shall bring it to the altar. 
\v 26 And the priest shall take a handful of the sacrifice as a memorial of it, and shall offer it up upon the altar; and afterwards he shall cause the woman to drink the water. 
\v 27 And it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have altogether escaped the notice of her husband, then the water of the conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her; and she shall swell in her belly, and her thigh shall rot, and the woman shall be for a curse in the midst of her people. 
\v 28 But if the woman have not been polluted, and be clean, then shall she be guiltless and shall \f + \fr 5:28  \fl Gr. \ft give out seed. \f* conceive seed. 
\v 29 This is the law of jealousy, wherein a married woman should happen to transgress, and be defiled; 
\v 30 or in the case of a man on whoever the spirit of jealousy should come, and he should be jealous of his wife, and he should place his wife before the Lord, and the priest shall execute towards her all this law. 
\v 31 Then the man shall be clear from sin, and that woman shall bear her sin.

\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, Whatsoever man or woman shall specially vow a vow to separate oneself with purity to the Lord, 
\v 3 he shall purely abstain from wine and strong drink; and he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink; and whatever is made of the grape he shall not drink; neither shall he eat fresh grapes or raisins, 
\v 4 all the days of his vow: he shall eat no one of all the things that come from the vine, wine from the grape-stones to the \f + \fr 6:4  \fl Gr. \ft grape-stones. \f* husk, 
\v 5 all the days of his separation:—a razor shall not come upon his head, until the days be fulfilled which he vowed to the Lord: he shall be holy, cherishing the \f + \fr 6:5  \fl Gr. \ft a head of hair \+add even \+add* hair, etc. \f* long hair of the head, 
\v 6 all the days of his vow to the Lord: he shall not come near to any dead body, 
\v 7 to his father or his mother, or to his brother or his sister; he shall not defile himself for them, when they have died, because the vow of God is upon him on his head. 
\v 8 All the days of his vow he shall be holy to the Lord. 
\v 9 And if any one should die suddenly by him, immediately the head of his vow shall be defiled; and he shall shave his head in whatever day he shall be purified: on the seventh day he shall be shaved. 
\v 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the doors of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 11 And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering; and the other for a whole burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him in the things wherein he sinned respecting the dead body, and he shall sanctify his head in that day, 
\v 12 in which he was consecrated to the Lord, \add all\add* the days of his vow; and he shall bring a lamb of a year old for a trespass-offering; and the former days shall not be reckoned, because the head of his vow was polluted. 
\v 13 And this is the law of him that has vowed: in whatever day he shall have fulfilled the days of his vow, he shall himself bring his gift to the doors of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 14 And he shall bring his gift to the Lord; one he-lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering; 
\v 15 and a basket of unleavened bread of fine flour, \add even\add* loaves kneaded with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his whole burnt offering. 
\v 17 And he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace-offering to the Lord with the basket of unleavened bread; and the priest shall offer its meat-offering and its drink-offering. 
\v 18 And he that has vowed shall shave the head of his consecration by the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and shall put the hairs on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offering. 
\v 19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened loaf from the basket, and one unleavened cake, and shall put them on the hands of the votary after he has shaved off his \f + \fr 6:19  \fl Gr. \ft his vow, compare Acts 18:18. \f* 
\v 20 And the priest shall present them as an offering before the Lord; it shall be the holy portion for the priest beside the breast of the heave-offering and beside the shoulder of the wave-offering: and afterwards the votary shall drink wine. 
\v 21 This is the law of the votary who shall have vowed to the Lord his gift to the Lord, concerning his vow, besides what he may be able to afford according to the value of his vow, which he may have vowed according to the law of separation. 
\v 22 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus you⌃ shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them, 
\v 24 The Lord bless you and keep you; 
\v 25 the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and have mercy upon you; 
\v 26 the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace. 
\v 27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I the Lord will bless them.

\v 1 And it came to pass in the day in which Moses finished \f + \fr 7:1  \fl Gr. \ft so as to set up. \f* the setting-up of the tabernacle, that he anointed it, and consecrated it, and all its furniture, and the altar and all its furniture, he even anointed them, and consecrated them.

\v 4 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 5 Take of them, and they shall be for the works of the services of the tabernacle of witness: and you shall give them to the Levites, to each one according to his ministration. 
\v 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. 
\v 7 And he gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gedson, according to their ministrations. 
\v 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari according to their ministrations, by Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak to Aaron, and you shall say to him, Whenever you shall set the lamps in order, the seven lamps shall give light opposite the candlestick. 
\v 3 And Aaron did so: on one side opposite the candlestick he lighted its lamps, as the Lord appointed Moses.

\v 5 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and you shall purify them. 
\v 7 And thus shall you perform their purification: you shall sprinkle them with water of purification, and a razor shall come upon the whole of their body, and they shall wash their garments, and shall be clean. 
\v 8 And they shall take one calf of the herd, and its meat-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: and you shall take a calf of a year old of the herd for a sin-offering. 
\v 9 And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of witness; and you shall assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel. 
\v 10 And you shall bring the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites. 
\v 11 And Aaron shall separate the Levites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Israel: and they shall be prepared \f + \fr 8:11  \fl Gr. \ft so as to perform. \f* to perform the works of the Lord. 
\v 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the calves; and you shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them. 
\v 13 And you shall set the Levites before the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons; and you shall give them as a gift before the Lord. 
\v 14 And you shall separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they shall be mine. 
\v 15 And afterwards the Levites shall go in to perform the works of the tabernacle of witness; and you shall purify them, and present them before the Lord. 
\v 16 For these are given to me for a present out of the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel that open every womb. 
\v 17 For every firstborn among the children of Israel \add is\add* mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. 
\v 18 And I took the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the children of Israel. 
\v 19 And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons of Israel to draw near to the holy things. 
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them. 
\v 21 So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them. 
\v 22 And afterwards the Levites went in to minister in their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons; as the Lord appointed Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them. 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 24 This is the \add ordinance\add* for the Levites; From five and twenty years old and upward, they shall go in to \f + \fr 8:24  \fl Gr. \ft do the work. \f* minister in the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 25 And from fifty years old \add the Levites\add* shall cease from the ministry, and shall not work any longer. 
\v 26 And his brother shall serve in the tabernacle of witness to keep charges, but he shall not do works: so shall you do to the Levites in their charges.

\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sina in the second year after they had gone forth from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, 
\v 2 Speak, and let the children of Israel keep the passover in its season. 
\v 3 On the fourteenth day of the first month at even, you shall keep it in its season; you shall keep it according to its law, and according to its ordinance. 
\v 4 And Moses ordered the children of Israel to sacrifice the passover, 
\v 5 on the fourteenth day of the first month in the wilderness of Sina, as the Lord appointed Moses, so the children of Israel did. 
\v 6 And there came men who were unclean by reason of a dead body, and they were not able to keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. 
\v 7 And those men said to \f + \fr 9:7  \fl Gr. \ft him. \f* Moses, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: shall we therefore fail to offer the gift to the Lord in its season in the midst of the children of Israel? 
\v 8 And Moses said to them, stand there, and I will hear what charge the Lord will give concerning you. 
\v 9 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whatever man shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or on a journey far off, among you, or among your posterity; he shall then keep the passover to the Lord, 
\v 11 in the second month, on the fourteenth day; in the evening they shall offer it, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it. 
\v 12 They shall not leave of it until the morrow, and they shall not break a bone of it; they shall sacrifice it according to the ordinance of the passover. 
\v 13 And whatever man shall be clean, and is not far off on a journey, and shall fail to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has not offered the gift to the Lord in its season: that man shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 14 And if there should come to you a stranger in your land, and should keep the passover to the Lord, he shall keep it according to the law of the passover and according to its ordinance: there shall be one law for you, both for the stranger, and for the native of the land. 
\v 15 And in the day in which the tabernacle was pitched the cloud covered the tabernacle, the \f + \fr 9:15  \fl Gr. \ft house. \f* place of the testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire till the morning. 
\v 16 So it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 
\v 17 And when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel departed; and in whatever place the cloud rested, there the children of Israel encamped. 
\v 18 The children of Israel shall encamp by the command of the Lord, and by the command of the Lord they shall remove: all the days in which the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp. And whenever the cloud shall be drawn over the tabernacle for many days, then the children of Israel shall keep the charge of God, and they shall not remove. 
\v 19 And it shall be, whenever the cloud overshadows the tabernacle \f + \fr 9:19  \fl Gr. \ft days by number. \f* a number of days, they shall encamp by the word of the Lord, and shall remove by the command of the Lord. 
\v 20 And it shall come to pass, whenever the cloud shall remain from the evening till the morning, and in the morning the cloud shall go up, then shall they remove by day or by night. 
\v 21 When the cloud continues \f + \fr 9:21  \fl Or, \ft more than a month. \f* a full month overshadowing the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp, and shall not depart. 
\v 22 For they shall depart by the command of the Lord: - they kept the charge of the Lord by the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Make to yourself two silver trumpets: you shall make them of beaten work; and they shall be to you for the purpose of calling the assembly, and of removing the \f + \fr 10:2  \fl i.e. \ft the successive encampments. \f* camps. 
\v 3 And you shall sound with them, and all the congregation shall be gathered to the door of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 4 And if they shall sound with one, all the rulers even the princes of Israel shall come to you. 
\v 5 And you⌃ shall sound an alarm, and the camps pitched eastward shall begin to move. 
\v 6 And you⌃ shall sound a second alarm, and the camps pitched southward shall move; and you⌃ shall sound a third alarm, and the camps pitched westward shall move forward; and you⌃ shall sound a fourth alarm, and they that encamp toward the north shall move forward: they shall sound an alarm at their departure. 
\v 7 And whenever you⌃ shall gather the assembly, you⌃ shall sound, but not an alarm. 
\v 8 And the priests the sons of Aaron shall sound with the trumpets; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for you throughout your generations. 
\v 9 And if you⌃ shall go forth to war in your land against your enemies that are opposed to you, then shall you⌃ sound with the trumpets; and you⌃ shall be had in remembrance before the Lord, and you⌃ shall be saved from your enemies. 
\v 10 And in the days of your gladness, and in your feasts, and in your new moons, you⌃ shall sound with the trumpets at your whole burnt offerings, and at the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and there shall be a memorial for you before your God: I \add am\add* the Lord your God. 
\v 11 And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud went up from the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel set forward with their baggage in the wilderness of Sina; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Pharan. 
\v 13 And the first rank departed by the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\v 14 And they first set in motion the order of the camp of the children of Juda with their host; and over their host \add was\add* Naasson, son of Aminadab. 
\v 15 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, \add was\add* Nathanael son of Sogar. 
\v 16 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zabulon, \add was\add* Eliab the son of Chaelon. 
\v 17 And they shall take down the tabernacle, and the sons of Gedson shall set forward, and the sons of Merari, who bear the tabernacle. 
\v 18 And the order of the camp of Ruben set forward with their host; and over their host \add was\add* Elisur the son of Sediur. 
\v 19 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Symeon, \add was\add* Salamiel son of Surisadai. 
\v 20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad, \add was\add* Elisaph the son of Raguel. 
\v 21 And the sons of Caath shall set forward bearing the holy things, and \f + \fr 10:21  \fl i.e. \ft the Gershonites and the Merarites. \fl A.V. \ft margin.\f* \add the others\add* shall set up the tabernacle until they arrive. 
\v 22 And the order of the camp of Ephraim shall set forward with their forces; and over their forces \add was\add* Elisama the son of Semiud. 
\v 23 And over the forces of the tribes of the sons of Manasse, \add was\add* Gamaliel the \add son\add* of Phadassur. 
\v 24 And over the forces of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, \add was\add* Abidan the \add son\add* of Gadeoni. 
\v 25 And the order of the camp of the sons of Dan shall set forward the last of all the camps, with their forces: and over their forces \add was\add* Achiezer the \add son\add* of Amisadai. 
\v 26 And over the forces of the tribe of the sons of Aser, \add was\add* Phageel the son of Echran. 
\v 27 And over the forces of the tribe of the sons of Nephthali, \add was\add* Achire the son of Aenan. 
\v 28 These \add are\add* the armies of the children of Israel; and they set forward with their forces. 
\v 29 And Moses said to Obab the son of Raguel the Madianite, the father-in-law of Moses, We are going forward to the place concerning which the Lord said, This will I give to you: Come with us, and we will do you good, for the Lord has spoken good concerning Israel. 
\v 30 And he said to him, I will not go, but \add I will go\add* to my land and to my kindred. 
\v 31 And he said, Leave us not, because you have been with us in the wilderness, and you shall be an elder among us. 
\v 32 And it shall come to pass if you will go with us, it shall even come to pass that in whatever things the Lord shall do us good, we will also do you good. 
\v 33 And they departed from the mount of the Lord a three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them a three days' journey to provide rest for them. 
\v 34 And the cloud overshadowed them by day, when they departed from the camp. 
\v 35 And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered: let all that hate you flee. 
\v 36 And in the resting he said, Turn again, O Lord, the thousands \add and\add* tens of thousands in Israel. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the people murmured sinfully before the Lord; and the Lord heard \add them\add* and was very angry; and fire was kindled among them from the Lord, and devoured a part of the camp. 
\v 2 And the people cried to Moses: and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was quenched. 
\v 3 And the name of that place was called \f + \fr 11:3  \fqa Heb. Taberah. \f* Burning; for a fire was kindled among them from the Lord. 
\v 4 And the mixed multitude among them lusted \f + \fr 11:4  \fl Gr. \ft lusted a lust. \f* exceedingly; and they and the children of Israel sat down and wept and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 
\v 5 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt freely; and the cucumbers, and the \f + \fr 11:5  \fl Or, \ft pumpkins. \f* melons, and the leeks, and the garlic, and the onions. 
\v 6 But now our soul is dried up; our eyes \add turn\add* to nothing but to the manna. 
\v 7 And the manna is as coriander seed, and the appearance of it the appearance of hoarfrost. 
\v 8 And the people went through the field, and gathered, and ground it in the mill, or pounded it in a mortar, and baked it in a pan, and made cakes of it; and the sweetness of it was as the taste \add of\add* wafer made with oil. 
\v 9 And when the dew came upon the camp by night, the manna came down upon it. 
\v 10 And Moses heard them weeping by their families, every one in his door: and the Lord was very angry; and the thing was evil in the sight of Moses. 
\v 11 And Moses said to the Lord, Why have you afflicted your servant, and why have I not found grace in your sight, that you should lay the weight of this people upon me? 
\v 12 Have I conceived all this people, or have I born them? that you say to me, Take them into your bosom, as a nurse would take her suckling, into the land which you swore to their fathers? 
\v 13 Whence have I flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
\v 14 I shall not be able to bear this people alone, for this thing is too heavy for me. 
\v 15 And if you do thus to me, kill me utterly, if I have found favor with you, that I may not see my affliction. 
\v 16 And the Lord said to Moses, Gather me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you yourself know that they are the elders of the people, and their scribes; and you shall bring them to the tabernacle of witness, and they shall stand there with you. 
\v 17 And I will go down, and speak there with you; and I will take of the spirit that is upon you, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear together with you the \f + \fr 11:17  \fl Or, \ft impetus. \f* burden of the people, and you shall not bear them alone. 
\v 18 And to the people you shall say, Purify yourselves for the morrow, and you⌃ shall eat flesh; for you⌃ wept before the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it \f + \fr 11:18  \fl Gr. \ft is. \f* was well with us in Egypt: and the Lord shall allow you to eat flesh, and you⌃ shall eat flesh. 
\v 19 You⌃ shall not eat one day, nor two, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days; 
\v 20 you⌃ shall eat for \f + \fr 11:20  \fl Gr. \ft a month of days. \f* a full month, until \add the flesh\add* come out at your nostrils; and it shall be \f + \fr 11:20  \fl Lit. \ft cholera. \f* nausea to you, because you⌃ disobeyed the Lord, who is among you, and wept before him, saying, What had we to do to come out of Egypt? 
\v 21 And Moses said, The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and you said, I will give them flesh to eat, and they shall eat a whole month. 
\v 22 Shall sheep and oxen be slain for them, and shall it suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and shall it suffice them? 
\v 23 And the Lord said to Moses, Shall not the hand of the Lord be fully sufficient? now shall you know whether my word shall \f + \fr 11:23  \fl Gr. \ft will overtake you. \f* come to pass to you or not. 
\v 24 And Moses went out, and spoke the words of the Lord to the people; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and he set them round about the tabernacle. 
\v 25 And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men that were elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and ceased. 
\v 26 And there were two men left in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Modad; and the spirit rested upon them, and these were of the number of them that were enrolled, but they did not come to the tabernacle; and they prophesied in the camp. 
\v 27 And a young man ran and told Moses, and spoke, saying, Eldad and Modad prophesy in the camp. 
\v 28 And Joshua the son of Naue, who attended on Moses, the chosen one, said, \add My\add* lord Moses, forbid them. 
\v 29 And Moses said to him, Are you jealous on my account? and would that all the Lord's people were prophets; whenever the Lord shall put his spirit upon them. 
\v 30 And Moses departed into the camp, himself and the elders of Israel. 
\v 31 And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails over from the sea; and it brought them down upon the camp a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on that side, round about the camp, as it were two cubits from the earth. 
\v 32 And the people rose up all the day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered quails; he that gathered \f + \fr 11:32  \fl Gr. \ft little. \f* least, gathered ten \f + \fr 11:32  \fl Gr. \ft cors. \f* measures; and they \f + \fr 11:32  \fl Gr. \ft refreshed refreshments to themselves. \fqa Heb. spread a spreading. וישמחו שמוח \f* refreshed themselves round about the camp. 
\v 33 The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it failed, when the Lord was angry with the people, and the Lord struck the people with a very great plague. 
\v 34 And the name of that place was called the Graves of Lust; for there they buried the people that lusted. 
\v 35 The people departed from the \f + \fr 11:35  \fqa Heb. קכווה החאוה Kibroth-hattaavah. \f* Graves of Lust to Aseroth; and the people \f + \fr 11:35  \fl Gr. \ft were in. \f* halted at Aseroth. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Mariam and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman whom Moses took; for he had taken an Ethiopian woman. 
\v 2 And they said, Has the Lord spoken to Moses only? has he not also spoken to us? and the Lord heard it. 
\v 3 And the man Moses was very meek beyond all the men that were upon the earth. 
\v 4 And the Lord said immediately to Moses and Aaron and Mariam, Come forth \f + \fr 12:4  \fl Gr. \ft the three. \f* all three of you to the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 5 And the three came forth to the tabernacle of witness; and the Lord descended in a pillar of a cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of witness; and Aaron and Mariam were called; and both came forth. 
\v 6 And he said to them, Hear my words: If there should be of you a prophet to the Lord, I will be made known to him in a vision, and in sleep will I speak to him. 
\v 7 My servant Moses \add is\add* not so; he is faithful in all my house. 
\v 8 I will speak to him mouth to mouth apparently, and not in dark speeches; and he has seen the glory of the Lord; and why were you⌃ not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 
\v 9 And the great anger of the Lord \add was\add* upon them, and he departed. 
\v 10 And the cloud departed from the tabernacle; and, behold, Mariam was leprous, \add white\add* as snow; and Aaron looked upon Mariam, and, behold, she \add was\add* leprous. 
\v 11 And Aaron said to Moses, I beseech you, my lord, do not lay sin upon us, for we were ignorant wherein we sinned. 
\v 12 Let her not be as it were like death, as an abortion coming out of his mother's womb, when \add the disease\add* devours the half of the flesh. 
\v 13 And Moses cried to the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech you, heal her. 
\v 14 And the Lord said to Moses, If her father had only spit in her face, \f + \fr 12:14  \fl Gr. \ft will. \f* would she not be ashamed seven days? let her be set apart seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall come in. 
\v 15 And Mariam was separated without the camp seven days; and the people moved not forward till Mariam was cleansed. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And afterwards the people set forth from Aseroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Pharan. 
\v 2 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 3 Send for you men, and let them spy the land of the Chananites, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession; one man for a tribe, you shall send them away according to their families, every one of them a prince. 
\v 4 And Moses sent them out of the wilderness of Pharan by the word of the Lord; all these \add were\add* the princes of the sons of Israel. 
\v 5 And these \add are\add* their names: of the tribe of Ruben, Samuel the son of Zachur. 
\v 6 Of the tribe of Symeon, Saphat the son of Suri. 
\v 7 Of the tribe of Judah, Chaleb the son of Jephonne. 
\v 8 Of the tribe of Issachar, Ilaal the son of Joseph. 
\v 9 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Ause the son of Naue. 
\v 10 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu. 
\v 11 Of the tribe of Zabulon, Gudiel the son of Sudi. 
\v 12 Of the tribe of Joseph of the sons of Manasse, Gaddi the son of Susi. 
\v 13 Of the tribe of Dan, Amiel the son of Gamali. 
\v 14 Of the tribe of Aser, Sathur the son of Michael. 
\v 15 Of the tribe of Nephthali, Nabi the son of Sabi. 
\v 16 Of the tribe of Gad, Gudiel the son of Macchi. 
\v 17 These \add are\add* the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses called Ause the son of Naue, Joshua. 
\v 18 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Chanaan, and said to them, Go up by this wilderness; and you⌃ shall go up to the mountain, 
\v 19 and you⌃ shall see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells on it, whether it is strong or weak, or \add whether\add* they are few or many. 
\v 20 And what the land is on which they dwell, \add whether\add* it is good or bad; and what the cities are wherein these dwell, whether they dwell in walled \add cities\add* or unwalled. 
\v 21 And what the land is, whether rich or \f + \fr 13:21  \fl Gr. q. d. \ft neglected \f* poor; whether there are trees in it or no: and you⌃ shall persevere and take of the fruits of the land: and the days \add were\add* the days of spring, the forerunners of the grape. 
\v 22 And they went up and surveyed the land from the wilderness of Sin to Rhoob, as men go in to Aemath. 
\v 23 And they went up by the wilderness, and departed as far as Chebron; and there \add was\add* Achiman, and Sessi, and Thelami, the progeny of Enach. Now Chebron was built seven years before Tanin of Egypt. 
\v 24 And they came to the valley of the cluster and surveyed it; and they cut down thence a bough and one cluster of grapes upon it, and bore it on staves, and \add they took\add* of the pomegranates and the figs. 
\v 25 And they called that place, The valley of the cluster, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence. 
\v 26 And they returned from thence, having surveyed the land, after forty days. 
\v 27 And they proceeded and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Pharan Cades; and they brought word to them and to all the congregation, and they showed the fruit of the land: 
\v 28 and they reported to him, and said, We came into the land into which you sent us, a land flowing with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. 
\v 29 Only the nation that dwells upon it is bold, and they have very great and strong walled towns, and we saw there the children of Enach. 
\v 30 And Amalec dwells in the land toward the south: and the Chettite and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwells in the hill country: and the Chananite dwells by the sea, and by the river Jordan. 
\v 31 And Chaleb stayed the people from speaking \f + \fr 13:31  \fl Or, \ft to. \f* before Moses, and said to him, Nay, but we will go up by all means, and will inherit it, for we shall surely prevail against them. 
\v 32 But the men that went up together with him said, We \f + \fr 13:32  \fl Gr. \ft do not. \f* will not go up, for we shall not by any means be able to go up against the nation, for it is much stronger than we. 
\v 33 And they brought a horror of that land which they surveyed upon the children of Israel, saying, The land which we passed by to survey it, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary stature. 
\v 34 And there we saw the giants; and we were before them as locusts, yes even so were we before them. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried; and the people wept all that night. 
\v 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron; and all the congregation said to them, 
\v 3 Would we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness, would we had died! and why does the Lord bring us into this land to fall in war? our wives and our children shall be for a prey: now then it is better to return into Egypt. 
\v 4 And they said one to another, Let us make a ruler, and return into Egypt. 
\v 5 And Moses and Aaron fell upon their face before all the congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 6 But Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue, and Chaleb the \add son\add* of Jephonne, of \add the number of\add* them that spied out the land, tore their garments, 
\v 7 and spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we surveyed is indeed extremely good. 
\v 8 If the Lord choose us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey. 
\v 9 Only depart not from the Lord; and fear you⌃ not the people of the land, for they are meat for us; for the season \add of prosperity\add* is departed from them, but the Lord \add is\add* among us: fear them not. 
\v 10 And all the congregation bade stone them with stones; and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud on the tabernacle of witness to all the children of Israel. 
\v 11 And the Lord said to Moses, How long does this people provoke me? and how long do they \f + \fr 14:11  \fl Gr. \ft not believe me. \f* refuse to believe me for all the signs which I have wrought among them? 
\v 12 I will strike them with death, and destroy them; and I will make of you and of your father's house a great nation, and much greater than this. 
\v 13 And Moses said to the Lord, So Egypt shall hear, for you have brought up this people from them by your might. 
\v 14 Moreover all the dwellers upon this land have heard that you are Lord in the midst of this people, who, O Lord, are seen \add by them\add* face to face, and your cloud rests upon them, and you go before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire. 
\v 15 And \add if\add* you shall destroy this nation as one man; then all the nations that have heard your name shall speak, saying, 
\v 16 Because the Lord could not bring this people into the land which he swore to them, he has overthrown them in the wilderness. 
\v 17 And now, O Lord, let your strength be exalted, as you spoke, saying, 
\v 18 The Lord \add is\add* longsuffering and merciful, and true, removing transgressions and iniquities and sins, and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation. 
\v 19 Forgive this people their sin according to your great mercy, as you were favourable to them from Egypt until now. 
\v 20 And the Lord said to Moses, I am gracious to them according to your word. 
\v 21 But \add as\add* I live and my name is living, so the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth. 
\v 22 For all the men who see my glory, and the signs which I wrought in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me this tenth time, and have not listened to my voice, 
\v 23 surely they shall not see the land, which I swore to their fathers; but their children which are with me here, as many as know not good or evil, every inexperienced youth, to them will I give the land; but none who have provoked me shall see it. 
\v 24 But my servant Chaleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he followed me, I will bring him into the land into which he entered, and his seed shall inherit it. 
\v 25 But Amalec and the Chananite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. 
\v 26 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 27 How long \add shall I endure\add* this wicked congregation? I have heard their murmurings against me, \add even\add* the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they have murmured concerning you. 
\v 28 Say to them, \add As\add* I live, says the Lord: surely as you⌃ spoke into my ears, so will I do to you. 
\v 29 Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me, 
\v 30 you⌃ shall not enter into the land for which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue. 
\v 31 And your little ones, who you⌃ said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land, \f + \fr 14:31  \fl Gr. \ft from which you⌃ turned away. \f* which you⌃ rejected. 
\v 32 And your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. 
\v 33 And your sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your fornication, until your carcasses be consumed in the wilderness. 
\v 34 According to the number of the days during which you⌃ spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, you⌃ shall bear your sins forty years, and you⌃ shall know my fierce anger. 
\v 35 I the Lord have spoken, Surely will I do thus to this evil congregation \f + \fr 14:35  \ft See ἐπισύστασις 2. Cor 11:28. \f* that has risen up together against me: in this wilderness they shall be utterly consumed, and there they shall die. 
\v 36 And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who came and murmured against it to the assembly so as to bring out evil words concerning the land, — 
\v 37 the men that spoke evil reports against the land, even died of the plague before the Lord. 
\v 38 And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of Jephonne \add still\add* lived of those men that went to spy out the land. 
\v 39 And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly. 
\v 40 And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we \f + \fr 14:40  \fl Gr. \ft these men. \f* that are here will go up to the place of which the Lord has spoken, because we have sinned. 
\v 41 And Moses said, Why do you⌃ transgress the word of the Lord? you⌃ shall not prosper. 
\v 42 Go not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall you⌃ fall before the face of your enemies. 
\v 43 For Amalec and the Chananite \add are\add* there before you, and you⌃ shall fall by the sword; because you⌃ have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you. 
\v 44 And having forced their passage, they went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses stirred not out of the camp. 
\v 45 And Amalec and the Chananite that lived in that mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them to Herman; and they returned to the camp. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you⌃ are come into the land of your habitation, which I give to you, 
\v 3 and you will offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, a whole burnt offering or a meat-offering to \f + \fr 15:3  \fl Gr. \ft magnify. \f* perform a vow, or a free-will offering, or to offer in your feasts a sacrifice of sweet savor to the Lord, whether of the herd or the flock: 
\v 4 then he that offers his gift to the Lord shall bring a meat-offering of fine flour, a tenth part of an ephah mingled with oil, even with the fourth part of a hin. 
\v 5 And for a drink-offering you⌃ shall offer the fourth part of a hin on the whole burnt offering, or on the meat-offering: for every lamb you shall offer so much, as a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord. 
\v 6 And for a ram, when you⌃ offer it as a whole burnt offering or as a sacrifice, you shall prepare as a meat-offering two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, the third part of a hin. 
\v 7 And you⌃ shall offer for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord wine for a drink-offering, the third part of a hin. 
\v 8 And if you⌃ sacrifice \add a bullock\add* from the herd for a whole burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to perform a vow or a peace-offering to the Lord, 
\v 9 then \add the worshipper\add* shall offer upon the calf a meat-offering, three tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, \add even\add* the half of a hin. 
\v 10 And wine for a drink-offering the half of a hin, a sacrifice for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord. 
\v 11 Thus shall you do to one calf or to one ram, or to one lamb of the sheep or kid of the goats. 
\v 12 According to the number of what you⌃ shall offer, so shall you⌃ do to each one, according to their number. 
\v 13 Every native of the country shall do thus to offer such things as sacrifices for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord. 
\v 14 And if there should be a stranger among you in your land, or one who should be born to you among your generations, and he will offer a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savor to the Lord—as you⌃ do, so the \add whole\add* congregation shall offer to the Lord. 
\v 15 There shall be one law for you and for the strangers dwelling among you, a perpetual law for your generations: as you⌃ \add are\add*, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. 
\v 16 There shall be one law and one ordinance for you, and for the stranger that abides among you. 
\v 17 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you⌃ are entering into the land, into which I bring you, 
\v 19 then it shall come to pass, when you⌃ shall eat of the bread of the land, you⌃ shall separate a wave-offering, a special offering to the Lord, the first fruits of your dough. 
\v 20 You⌃ shall offer your bread a heave-offering: as a heave-offering from the threshing floor, so shall you⌃ separate it, 
\v 21 even the first fruits of your dough, and you⌃ shall give the Lord a heave-offering throughout your generations. 
\v 22 But whenever you⌃ shall transgress, and not perform all these commands, which the Lord spoke to Moses; 
\v 23 as the Lord appointed you by the hand of Moses, from the day which the Lord appointed you and forward throughout your generations, 
\v 24 then it shall come to pass, if a trespass be committed unwillingly, unknown to the congregation, then shall all the congregation offer a calf of the herd without blemish for a whole burnt offering of sweet savor to the Lord, and its meat-offering and its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering. 
\v 25 And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and \add the trespass\add* shall be forgiven them, because it is involuntary; and they have brought their gift, a burnt offering to the Lord for their trespass before the Lord, even for their involuntary sins. 
\v 26 And it shall be forgiven as respects all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that is dwelling among you, because \add it is\add* involuntary to all the people. 
\v 27 And if one soul sin unwillingly, he shall bring one she-goat of a year old for a sin-offering. 
\v 28 And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that committed the trespass unwillingly, and that sinned unwillingly before the Lord, to make atonement for him. 
\v 29 There shall be one law for the native among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that abides among them, whoever shall commit a trespass unwillingly. 
\v 30 And whatever soul either of the natives or of the strangers shall do any thing with a presumptuous hand, he will provoke God; that soul shall be cut off from his people, 
\v 31 for he has set at nothing the word of the Lord and broken his commands: that soul shall be utterly destroyed, his sin \add is\add* upon him. 
\v 32 And the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath-day. 
\v 33 And they who found him gathering sticks on the sabbath-day brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 34 And they placed him in custody, for they did not determine what they should do to him. 
\v 35 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man be by all means put to death: \add do you⌃\add* all the congregation, stone him with stones. 
\v 36 And all the congregation brought him forth out of the camp; and all the congregation stoned him with stones outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
\v 37 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 38 Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall tell them; and let them make for themselves fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their generations: and you⌃ shall put upon the fringes of the borders a lace of blue. 
\v 39 And it shall be on your fringes, and you⌃ shall look on them, and you⌃ shall remember all the commands of the Lord, and do them: and you⌃ shall not turn back after your imaginations, and after \add the sight of your\add* eyes in the things after which you⌃ go a whoring; 
\v 40 that you⌃ may remember and perform all my commands, and you⌃ shall be holy to your God. 
\v 41 I \add am\add* the Lord your God that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I \add am\add* the Lord your God.

\v 1 And Core the son of Isaar the son of Caath the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab, and Aun the son of Phaleth the son of Ruben, spoke; 
\v 2 and rose up before Moses, and two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, chiefs of the assembly, chosen councillors, and men of renown. 
\v 3 They rose up against Moses and Aaron, and said, Let it be enough for you that all the congregation \add are\add* holy, and the Lord \add is\add* among them; and why do you⌃ set up yourselves against the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 4 And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face. 
\v 5 And he spoke to Core and all his assembly, saying, God has visited and known those that are his and who are holy, and has brought them to himself; and whom he has chosen for himself, he has brought to himself. 
\v 6 This do you⌃: take to yourselves censers, Core and all his company; 
\v 7 and put fire on them, and put incense on them before the Lord to-morrow; and it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord has chosen, he shall be holy: let it be enough for you, you⌃ sons of Levi. 
\v 8 And Moses said to Core, Listen to me, you⌃ sons of Levi. 
\v 9 Is it a little thing for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, and brought you near to himself to minister in the services of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the tabernacle to minister for them? 
\v 10 And he has brought you near and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you, and do you⌃ seek to be priests also? 
\v 11 Thus \add it is with\add* you and all your congregation which is gathered together against God: and who is Aaron, that you⌃ murmur against him? 
\v 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron sons of Eliab; and they said, We \f + \fr 16:12  \fl Gr. \ft do not. \f* will not go up. 
\v 13 Is it a little thing that you have brought us up \f + \fr 16:13  \ft Some read, out of. \f* to a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, \add and\add* that you altogether rule over us? 
\v 14 You are a prince, and have you brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and have you given us an inheritance of land and vineyards? would you have \f + \fr 16:14  \fl Gr. \ft cut out. \f* put out the eyes of those men? we \f + \fr 16:14  \fl Gr. \ft do not. \f* will not go up. 
\v 15 And Moses was exceeding indignant, and said to the Lord, Do you take no heed to their sacrifice: I have not taken away \f + \fr 16:15  \ft חפד for חפוד \f* the desire of any one of them, neither have I hurt any one of them. 
\v 16 And Moses said to Core, Sanctify your company, and be ready before the Lord, you and Aaron and they, to-morrow. 
\v 17 And take each man his censer, and you⌃ shall put incense upon them, and shall bring each one his censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty censers, and you and Aaron shall bring each his censer. 
\v 18 And each man took his censer, and they put on them fire, and laid incense on them; and Moses and Aaron stood by the doors of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 19 And Core raised up against them all his company by the door of the tabernacle of witness; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation. 
\v 20 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 21 Separate your selves from the midst of this congregation, and I will consume them at once. 
\v 22 And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, if one man has sinned, \add shall\add* the wrath of the Lord \add be\add* upon the whole congregation? 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speak to the congregation, saying, Depart from the company of Core round about. 
\v 25 And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiron, and all the elders of Israel went with him. 
\v 26 And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Separate yourselves from the tents of these stubborn men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, lest you⌃ be consumed with them in all their sin. 
\v 27 And they stood aloof from the tent of Core round about; and Dathan and Abiron went forth and stood by the doors of their tents, and their wives and their children and their store. 
\v 28 And Moses said, Hereby shall you⌃ know that the Lord has sent me to perform all these works, that \add I have\add* not \add done them\add* of myself. 
\v 29 If these men shall die according to the death of all men, if also their visitation shall be according to the visitation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me. 
\v 30 But if the Lord shall show by a \f + \fr 16:30  \fl Or, \ft vision. Some copies read χάσματι \f* wonder, and the earth shall open her mouth and swallow them up, and their houses, and their tents, and all that belongs to them, and they shall go down alive into Hades, then you⌃ shall know that these men have provoked the Lord. 
\v 31 And when he ceased speaking all these words, the ground clave asunder beneath them. 
\v 32 And the ground opened, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that were with Core, and their cattle. 
\v 33 And they went down and all that they had, alive into Hades; and the ground covered them, and they perished from the midst of the congregation. 
\v 34 And all Israel round about them fled from the sound of them, for \f + \fr 16:34  \fl Gr. \ft saying. \f* they said, Lest the earth swallow us up \add also\add*. 
\v 35 And fire went forth from the Lord, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 
\v 36 And the Lord said to Moses, 
\v 37 and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, Take up the brazen censers out of the midst of the men that have been burnt, and scatter the strange fire yonder, for they have sanctified the censers 
\v 38 of these sinners against their own souls, and do you make them beaten plates a covering to the altar, because they were brought before the Lord and hallowed; and they became a sign to the children of Israel. 
\v 39 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest took the brazen censers, which the men who had been burnt brought near, and they put them as a covering on the altar: 
\v 40 a memorial to the children of Israel that no stranger might draw near, who is not of the seed of Aaron, to offer incense before the Lord; so he shall not be as Core and as they that conspired with him, as the Lord spoke to him by the hand of Moses. 
\v 41 And the children of Israel murmured the next day against Moses and Aaron, saying, You⌃ have killed the people of the Lord. 
\v 42 And it came to pass when the congregation combined against Moses and Aaron, that they ran impetuously to the tabernacle of witness; and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared. 
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron went in, in front of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 44 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 45 Depart out of the midst of this congregation, and I will consume them at once: and they fell upon their faces. 
\v 46 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put on it fire from the altar, and put incense on it, and carry it away quickly into the camp, and make atonement for them; for wrath is gone forth from the presence of the Lord, it has begun to destroy the people. 
\v 47 And Aaron took as Moses spoke to him, and ran among the congregation, for already the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
\v 48 And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague ceased. 
\v 49 And they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died on account of Core. 
\v 50 And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and the plague ceased.

\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, and take \f + \fr 17:2  \fl Gr. \ft a rod \f* rods of them, according to the houses of their families, a rod from all their princes, according to the houses of their families, twelve rods, and write the name of each on his rod. 
\v 3 And write the name of Aaron on the rod of Levi; for it is one rod \add for each\add*: they shall give \add them\add* according to the tribe of the house of their families. 
\v 4 And you shall put them in the tabernacle of witness, before the testimony, where I will be made known to you. 
\v 5 And it shall be, the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall blossom; and I will remove from me the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you. 
\v 6 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their chiefs gave him a rod \add each\add*, for one chief a rod, according to the house of their families, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron \add was\add* in the midst of the rods. 
\v 7 And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed, and put forth a bud, and bloomed blossoms and produced almonds. 
\v 9 And Moses brought forth all the rods from before the Lord to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each one took his rod. 
\v 10 And the Lord said to Moses, Lay up the rod of Aaron before the testimonies to be kept as a sign for the children of the disobedient; and let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die. 
\v 11 And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded Moses, so did they. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we are cut off, we are destroyed, we are consumed. 
\v 13 Every one that touches the tabernacle of the Lord, dies: shall we die utterly? 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, You and your sons and your father's house shall bear the sins of the holy things, and you and your sons shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
\v 2 And take to yourself your brethren the tribe of Levi, the family of your father, and let them be joined to you, and let them minister to you; and you and your sons with you \add shall minister\add* before the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 3 And they shall keep your charges, and the charges of the tabernacle; only they shall not approach the holy vessels and the altar, so both they and you shall not die. 
\v 4 And they shall be joined to you, and shall keep the charges of the tabernacle of witness, in all the services of the tabernacle; and a stranger shall not approach to you. 
\v 5 And you⌃ shall keep the charges of the holy things, and the charges of the altar, and \add so\add* there shall not be anger \f + \fr 18:5  \fl Gr. \ft in. \f* among the children of Israel. 
\v 6 And I have taken your brethren the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, a present given to the Lord, to minister in the services of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 7 And you and your sons after you shall keep up your priestly ministration, according to the whole manner of the altar, and that which is within the veil; and you⌃ shall minister in the services as the office of your priesthood; and the stranger that comes near shall die. 
\v 8 And the Lord said to Aaron, And, behold, I have given you the charge of the first fruits of all things consecrated to me by the children of Israel; and I have given them to you as an honor, and to your sons after you for a perpetual ordinance. 
\v 9 And let this be to you from all the holy things that are consecrated \add to me, even\add* the burnt offerings, from all their gifts, and from all their sacrifices, and from every trespass-offering of theirs, and from all their sin-offerings, whatever things they give to me of all their holy things, they shall be yours and your sons'. 
\v 10 In the most holy place shall you⌃ eat them; every male shall eat them, you and your sons: they shall be holy to you. 
\v 11 And this shall be to you of the first fruits of their gifts, of all the \f + \fr 18:11  \fqa Heb. חנפה. Such appears its general meaning. \f* wave-offerings of the children of Israel; to you have I given them and to your sons and your daughters with you, a perpetual ordinance; every clean person in your house shall eat them. 
\v 12 Every first-offering of oil, and every first-offering of wine, their first fruits of corn, whatever they may give to the Lord, to you have I given them. 
\v 13 All the first fruits that are in their land, whatever they shall offer to the Lord, shall be yours: every clean person in your house shall eat them. 
\v 14 Every devoted thing among the children of Israel shall be yours. 
\v 15 And every thing that opens the womb of all flesh, whatever they bring to the Lord, whether man or beast, shall be yours: only the firstborn of men shall be surely redeemed, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean cattle. 
\v 16 And the redemption of them \add shall be\add* from a month old; their valuation of five shekels—it is twenty oboli according to the holy shekel. 
\v 17 But you shall not redeem the firstborn \f + \fr 18:17  \fl i. e. \ft among. But μόσχος is used elsewhere in the LXX. for horned cattle old enough to breed. \f* of calves and the firstborn of sheep and the firstborn of goats; they are holy: and you shall pour their blood upon the altar, and you shall offer the fat as a burnt offering for a smell of sweet savor to the Lord. 
\v 18 And the flesh shall be yours, as also the breast of the wave-offering and as the right shoulder, it shall be yours. 
\v 19 Every special offering of the holy things, whatever the children of Israel shall specially offer to the Lord, I have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you, a perpetual ordinance: it is a covenant \f + \fr 18:19  \fl Gr. \ft of perpetual salt. \f* of salt for ever before the Lord, for you and your seed after you. 
\v 20 And the Lord said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them; for I \add am\add* your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel. 
\v 21 And, behold, I have given to the sons of Levi every tithe in Israel for an inheritance for their services, whenever they perform ministry in the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 22 And the children of Israel shall no more draw near to the tabernacle of witness to incur fatal guilt. 
\v 23 And the Levite himself shall perform the service of the tabernacle of witness; and they shall bear their iniquities, it is a perpetual statute throughout their generations; and in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not receive an inheritance. 
\v 24 Because I have given as a distinct portion to the Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the children of Israel, whatever they shall offer to the Lord; therefore I said to them, In the midst of the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
\v 25 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 26 You shall also speak to the Levites, and shall say to them, If you⌃ take the tithe from the children of Israel, which I have given you from them for an inheritance, then shall you⌃ separate from it a heave-offering to the Lord, a tenth of the tenth. 
\v 27 And your heave-offerings shall be reckoned to you as corn from the floor, and an offering from the wine-press. 
\v 28 So shall you⌃ also separate them from all the offerings of the Lord out of all your tithes, whatever you⌃ shall receive from the children of Israel; and you⌃ shall give of them an offering to the Lord to Aaron the priest. 
\v 29 Of all your gifts you⌃ shall offer an offering to the Lord, and of every first-fruit the consecrated part from it. 
\v 30 And you shall say to them, When you⌃ shall offer the first fruits from it, then shall it be reckoned to the Levites as produce from the threshing floor, and as produce from the wine-press. 
\v 31 And you⌃ shall eat it in any place, you⌃ and your families; for this is your reward for your services in the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 32 And you⌃ shall not bear sin by reason of it, \f + \fr 18:32  \fl Or, \ft because you⌃ shall \f* for you⌃ shall have offered an offering of first fruits from it, and you⌃ shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you⌃ die not.

\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 This is the constitution of the law, as the Lord has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them take for you a red heifer without spot, which has no spot on her, and on which no yoke has been put. 
\v 3 And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest; and they shall bring her out of the camp into a clean place, and shall kill her before his face. 
\v 4 And Eleazar shall take of her blood, and sprinkle of her blood seven times in front of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 5 And they shall burn her to ashes before him; and her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall be consumed. 
\v 6 And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool, and they shall cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
\v 7 And the priest shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he shall go into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean till evening. 
\v 8 And he that burns her shall wash his garments, and bathe his body, and shall be unclean till evening. 
\v 9 And a clean man shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up in a clean place outside the camp; and they shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel to keep: it is the water of sprinkling, a purification. 
\v 10 And he that gathers up the ashes of the heifer shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute for the children of Israel and for the strangers joined to them. 
\v 11 He that touches the dead body of any man, shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 12 He shall be purified on the third day and the seventh day, and shall be clean; but if he be not purged on the third day and the seventh day, he shall not be clean. 
\v 13 Every one that touches the carcass of the person of a man, if he should have died, and \add the other\add* not have been purified, has defiled the tabernacle of the Lord: that soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. 
\v 14 And this \add is\add* the law; if a man die in a house, every one that goes into the house, and all things in the house, shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 15 And every open vessel which has not a covering bound upon it, shall be unclean. 
\v 16 And every one who shall touch a man slain by violence, or a corpse, or human bone, or sepulchre, shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 17 And they shall take for the unclean of the burnt ashes of purification, and they shall pour upon them running water into a vessel. 
\v 18 And a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it into the water, and sprinkle it upon the house, and the furniture, and all the souls that are therein, and upon him that touched the human bone, or the slain man, or the corpse, or the tomb. 
\v 19 And the clean man shall sprinkle \add the water\add* on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he shall purify himself; and \add the other\add* shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 
\v 20 And whatever man shall be defiled and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because he has defiled the holy things of the Lord, because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 
\v 21 And it shall be to you a perpetual statute; and he that sprinkles the water of sprinkling shall wash his garments; and he that touches the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until evening. 
\v 22 And whatever the unclean man shall touch shall be unclean, and the soul that touches it shall be unclean till evening.

\v 1 And the children of Israel, \add even\add* the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Sin, in the first month, and the people abode in Cades; and Mariam died there, and was buried there. 
\v 2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron. 
\v 3 And the people reviled Moses, saying, Would we had died in the destruction of our brethren before the Lord! 
\v 4 And therefore have you⌃ brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to kill us and our cattle? 
\v 5 And therefore \add is\add* this? You⌃ have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should come into this evil place; a place where there is no sowing, neither figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared to them. 
\v 7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 8 Take your rod, and call the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak you⌃ to the rock before them, and it shall give forth its waters; and you⌃ shall bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle. 
\v 9 And Moses took his rod which was before the Lord, as the Lord commanded. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and said to them, Hear me, you⌃ disobedient ones; must we bring you water out of this rock? 
\v 11 And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. 
\v 12 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you⌃ have not believed me to sanctify me before the children of Israel, therefore you⌃ shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 
\v 13 This is the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. 
\v 14 And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says your brother Israel; You know all the distress that has \f + \fr 20:14  \fl Gr. \ft found us \f* come upon us. 
\v 15 And \add how\add* our fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers. 
\v 16 And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the city of Cades, at the extremity of your coasts. 
\v 17 We will pass through your land: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of your cistern: we will go by the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed your borders. 
\v 18 And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet you in war. 
\v 19 And the children of Israel say to him, We will pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of your water, I will pay you: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain. 
\v 20 And he said, You shall not pass through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty hand. 
\v 21 So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him. 
\v 22 And they departed from Cades; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or. 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying, 
\v 24 Let Aaron be added to his people; for you⌃ shall certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because you⌃ provoked me at the water of strife. 
\v 25 Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to the mount Or before all the congregation; 
\v 26 and take Aaron's apparel from off him, and put it on Eleazar his son: and let Aaron die there and be added to \add his people\add*. 
\v 27 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and took him up to mount Or, before all the congregation. 
\v 28 And he took Aaron's garments off him, and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
\v 29 And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead: and they wept for Aaron thirty days, \add even\add* all the house of Israel.

\v 1 And Arad the Chananitish king who lived by the wilderness, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharin; and he made war on Israel, and carried off \f + \fr 21:1  \fl Gr. \ft a captivity of them. \f* some of them captives. 
\v 2 And Israel vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If you will deliver this people into my power, I will devote it and its cities \add to you\add*. 
\v 3 And the Lord listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered the Chananite into his power; and \add Israel\add* devoted him and his cities, and they called the name of that place \f + \fr 21:3  \fl Gr. \ft devoted thing. \f* Anathema. 
\v 4 And having departed from mount Or by the way \add leading\add* to the Red Sea, they compassed the land of Edom, and the people lost courage by the way. 
\v 5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, saying, Why is this? Have you brought us ought of Egypt to kill us in the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread. 
\v 6 And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died. 
\v 7 And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against you: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the serpent from us. 
\v 8 And Moses prayed to the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make you a serpent, and put it on a signal-\add staff\add*; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent shall bite a man, every one \add so\add* bitten that looks upon it shall live. 
\v 9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a signal-\add staff\add*: and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived. 
\v 10 And the children of Israel departed, and encamped in Oboth. 
\v 11 And having departed from Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness, which is opposite Moab, toward the east. 
\v 12 And thence they departed, and encamped in the valley of Zared. 
\v 13 And they departed thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness, \add the country\add* which extends from the coasts of the \f + \fr 21:13  \fl Gr. \ft Amorite \f* Amorites; for Arnon is the borders of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
\v 14 Therefore it is said in a book, A war of the Lord has set on fire Zoob, and the brooks of Arnon. 
\v 15 And he has appointed brooks to cause Er to dwell \add there\add*; and it lies near to the coasts of Moab. 
\v 16 And thence \add they came to\add* the well; this \add is\add* the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people, and I will give them water to drink. 
\v 17 Then Israel sang this song at the well, Begin \add to sing\add* \f + \fr 21:17  \fl Gr. \ft of the well for it \f* of the well; 
\v 18 the princes digged it, the kings of the nations in their kingdom, in their lordship sank it in the rock: and \add they went\add* from the well to Manthanain, 
\v 19 and from Manthanain to Naaliel, and from Naaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to \f + \fr 21:19  \fl Or, \ft Jané but the reading is uncertain. \f* Janen, which is in the plain of Moab \add as seen\add* from the top of the quarried \add rock\add* that looks toward the wilderness. 
\v 20 And Moses sent ambassadors to Seon king of the Amorites, with peaceful words, saying, 
\v 21 We will pass through your land, we will go by the road; we will not turn aside to the field or to the vineyard. 
\v 22 We will not drink water out of your well; we will go by the king's highway, until we have past your boundaries. 
\v 23 And Seon did not allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Seon gathered all his people, and went out to set the battle in array against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jassa, and set the battle in array against Israel. 
\v 24 And Israel struck him with the slaughter of the sword, and they became possessors of his land, from Arnon to Jaboc, as far as the children of Amman, for Jazer is the borders of the children of Amman. 
\v 25 And Israel took all their cities, and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Esebon, and in all cities belonging to it. 
\v 26 For Esebon is the city of Seon king of the Amorites; and he before fought against the king of Moab, and they took all his land, from Aroer to Arnon. 
\v 27 Therefore say they who deal in dark speeches, Come to Esebon, that the city of Seon may be built and prepared. 
\v 28 For a fire has gone forth from Esebon, a flame from the city of Seon, and has consumed as far as Moab, and devoured the pillars of Arnon. 
\v 29 Woe to you, Moab; you are lost, you people of Chamos: their sons are sold for preservation, and their daughters are captives to Seon king of the Amorites. 
\v 30 And their seed shall perish \add from\add* Esebon to Daebon; and their women have yet farther kindled a fire against Moab. 
\v 31 And Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites. 
\v 32 And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took it, and its villages, and cast out the Amorite that lived there. 
\v 33 And having returned, they went up the road that leads to Basan; and Og the king of Basan went forth to meet them, and all his people to war to Edrain. 
\v 34 And the Lord said to Moses, Fear him not; for I have delivered him and all his people, and all his land, into your hands; and you shall do to him as you did to Seon king of the Amorites, who lived in Esebon. 
\v 35 And he struck him and his sons, and all his people, until he left none of his to be taken alive; and they inherited his land. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel departed, and encamped on the west of Moab by Jordan toward Jericho. 
\v 2 And when Balac son of Sepphor saw all that Israel did to the Amorite, 
\v 3 then Moab feared the people exceedingly because they were many; and Moab was grieved \f + \fr 22:3  \fl q. d. \ft because of \fl hebraism.\f* before the face of the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And Moab said to the elders of Madiam, Now shall this assembly lick up all that are round about us, as a calf would lick up the green \add herbs\add* of the field:—and Balac son of Sepphor was king of Moab at that time. 
\v 5 And he sent ambassadors to Balaam the son of Beor, to Phathura, which is on a river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and behold it has covered the face of the earth, and it has encamped close to me. 
\v 6 And now come, curse me this people, for it is stronger than we; if we may be able to strike some of them, and I will cast them out of the land: for I know that whoever you do bless, they are blessed, and whoever you do curse, they are cursed. 
\v 7 And the elders of Moab went, and the elders of Madiam, and their divining \add instruments were\add* in their hands; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balac. 
\v 8 And he said to them, Tarry here the night, and I will answer you the things which the Lord shall say to me; and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
\v 9 And God came to Balaam, and said to him, Who are these men with you? 
\v 10 And Balaam said to God, Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab, sent them to me, saying, 
\v 11 Behold, a people has come forth out of Egypt, and has covered the face of the land, and it has encamped near to me; and now come, curse it for me, if indeed I shall be able to strike it, and cast it out of the land. 
\v 12 And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them, neither shall you curse the people; for they are blessed. 
\v 13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balac, Depart quickly to your lord; God does not permit me to go with you. 
\v 14 And the princes of Moab rose, and came to Balac, and said, Balaam will not come with us. 
\v 15 And Balac yet again sent more princes and more honorable than they. 
\v 16 And they came to Balaam, and they say to him, Thus says Balac the son of Sepphor: I beseech you, delay not to come to me. 
\v 17 For I will greatly honor you, and will do for you whatever you shall say; come then, curse me this people. 
\v 18 And Balaam answered and said to the princes of Balac, If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord God, to make it little or great in my mind. 
\v 19 And now do you⌃ also wait here this night, and I shall know what the Lord will yet say to me. 
\v 20 And God came to Balaam by night, and said to him, If these men are come to call you, rise and follow them; nevertheless the word which I shall speak to you, it shall you do. 
\v 21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 
\v 22 And God was very angry because he went; and the angel of the Lord rose up to withstand him. Now he had mounted his ass, and his two servants were with him. 
\v 23 And when the ass saw the angel of God standing opposite in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and \add Balaam\add* struck the ass with his staff to direct her in the way. 
\v 24 And the angel of the Lord stood in the avenues of the vines, a fence \add being\add* on this side and a fence on that. 
\v 25 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall, and he struck her again. 
\v 26 And the angel of the Lord went farther, and came and stood in a narrow place where it was impossible to turn to the right or the left. 
\v 27 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she \f + \fr 22:27  \fl Gr. \ft sat down. \f* lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was angry, and struck the ass with his staff. 
\v 28 And God opened the mouth of the ass, and she says to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me this third time? 
\v 29 And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me; and if I \add had\add* had a sword in my hand, I would now have killed you. 
\v 30 And the ass says to Balaam, \add Am\add* not I your ass on which you have ridden since your youth till this day? did I ever do thus to you, utterly disregarding \add you\add*? and he said, No. 
\v 31 And God opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the Lord withstanding \add him\add* in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, and he stooped down and worshipped on his face. 
\v 32 And the angel of God said to him, Why have you struck your ass this third time? and, behold, I came out to withstand you, for your way was not seemly before me; and when the ass saw me, she turned away from me this third time. 
\v 33 And if she had not turned out of the way, surely now, I should have slain you, and should have saved her alive. 
\v 34 And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing opposite in the way to meet \add me\add*; and now if it shall not be pleasing to you \add for me to go on\add*, I will return. 
\v 35 And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men: nevertheless the word which I shall speak to you, that you shall take heed to speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balac. 
\v 36 And when Balac heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on the borders of Arnon, which is on the \add extreme\add* part of the borders. 
\v 37 And Balac said to Balaam, Did I not send to you to call you? why have you not come to me? shall I not indeed be able to honor you? 
\v 38 And Balaam said to Balac, Behold, I am now come to you: shall I be able to say anything? the word which God shall put into my mouth, that I shall speak. 
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balac, and they came to \f + \fr 22:39  \fl Or, \ft cities of villages. \fqa Heb. \f* the cities of streets. 
\v 40 And Balac offered sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to his princes who were with him. 
\v 41 And it was morning; and Balac took Balaam, and brought him up to the pillar of Baal, and showed him thence a part of the people. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Balaam said to Balac, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams. 
\v 2 And Balac did as Balaam told him; and he offered up a calf and a ram on \add every\add* altar. 
\v 3 And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by your sacrifice, and I will go and see if God \f + \fr 23:3  \fl Gr. \ft appear to me in meeting \f* will appear to me and meet me, and the word which he shall show me, I will report to you. And Balac stood by his sacrifice. 
\v 4 And Balaam went to enquire of God; and he went straight forward, and God appeared to Balaam; and Balaam said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and have offered a calf and a ram on \add every\add* altar. 
\v 5 And God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, and said, you shall return to Balac, and thus shall you speak. 
\v 6 And he returned to him, and moreover he stood over his whole burnt offerings, and all the princes of Moab with him; and the Spirit of God came upon him. 
\v 7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balac king of Moab sent for me out of Mesopotamia, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and Come, call for a curse for me upon Israel. 
\v 8 How can I curse whom the Lord curses not? or how can I devote whom God devotes not? 
\v 9 For from the top of the mountains I shall see him, and from the hills I shall observe him: behold, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
\v 10 Who has exactly calculated the seed of Jacob, and who shall number the families of Israel? let my soul die with the souls of the righteous, and let my seed be as their seed. 
\v 11 And Balac said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I called you to curse my enemies, and behold you have greatly blessed \add them\add*. 
\v 12 And Balaam said to Balac, Whatsoever the Lord shall put into my mouth, shall I not take heed to speak this? 
\v 13 And Balac said to him, Come yet with me to another place where you shall not see \f + \fr 23:13  \fl Gr. \ft him \fl or \ft it \f* the people, but only you shall see a part of them, and shall not see them all; and curse me them from thence. 
\v 14 And he took him to a high place of the field to the top of the quarried \add rock\add*, and he built there seven altars, and offered a calf and a ram on \add every\add* altar. 
\v 15 And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by your sacrifice, and I will go to enquire of God. 
\v 16 And God met Balaam, and put a word into his mouth, and said, return to Balac, and thus shall you speak. 
\v 17 And he returned to him: and he also was standing by his whole burnt sacrifice, and all the princes of Moab with him; and Balac said to him, What has the Lord spoken? 
\v 18 And he took up his parable, and said, rise up, Balac, and hear; listen as a witness, you son of Sepphor. 
\v 19 God is not as man to waver, nor as the son of man to be threatened; shall he say and not perform? shall he speak and not keep \add to his word\add*? 
\v 20 Behold, I have received \add commandment\add* to bless: I will bless, and not turn back. 
\v 21 There shall not be trouble in Jacob, neither shall sorrow be seen in Israel: the Lord his God \add is\add* with him, the glories of rulers \add are\add* in him. 
\v 22 It was God who brought him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a unicorn. 
\v 23 For there is no divination \f + \fr 23:23  \ft against \f* in Jacob, nor enchantment in Israel; in season it shall be told to Jacob and Israel \f + \fr 23:23  \fl or, \ft what shall God perform? \f* what God shall perform. 
\v 24 Behold, the people shall rise up as a lion's whelp, and shall exalt himself as a lion; he shall not lie down till he have eaten the prey, and he shall drink the blood of the slain. 
\v 25 And Balac said to Balaam, Neither curse \f + \fr 23:25  \fl Gr. \ft him. \f* the people at all for me, nor bless them at all. 
\v 26 And Balaam answered and said to Balac, Spoke I not to you, saying, Whatsoever thing God shall speak to me, that will I do? 
\v 27 And Balac said to Balaam, Come \add and\add* I will remove you to another place, if it shall please God, and curse me them from thence. 
\v 28 And Balac took Balaam to the top of Phogor, which extends to the wilderness. 
\v 29 And Balaam said to Balac, build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams. 
\v 30 And Balac did as Balaam told him, and offered a calf and a ram on \add every\add* altar. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased God to bless Israel, he did not go according to his custom to meet the omens, but turned his face toward the wilderness. 
\v 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and sees Israel encamped by their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him. 
\v 3 And he took up his parable and said, Balaam son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says, 
\v 4 he says who hears the oracle of the Mighty One, who saw a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were opened: 
\v 5 How goodly \add are\add* your habitations, Jacob, and your tents, Israel! 
\v 6 as shady groves, and as gardens by a river, and as tents which God pitched, and as cedars by the waters. 
\v 7 There shall come a man out of his seed, and he shall rule over many nations; and the kingdom of Gog shall be exalted, and his kingdom shall be increased. 
\v 8 God led him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a unicorn: he shall consume the nations of his enemies, and he shall \f + \fr 24:8  \fl Gr. \ft suck the marrow out of their fat \fqa bones\f* drain their marrow, and with his darts he shall shoot through the enemy. 
\v 9 He lay down, he rested as a lion, and as a young lion; who shall stir him up? they that bless you are blessed, and they that curse you are cursed. 
\v 10 And Balac was angry with Balaam, and clapped his hands together; and Balac said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemy, and behold you have decidedly blessed \add him\add* this third time. 
\v 11 Now therefore flee to your place: I said, I will honor you, but now the Lord has deprived you of glory. 
\v 12 And Balaam said to Balac, Did I not speak to your messengers also whom you sent to me, saying, 
\v 13 If Balac should give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to \f + \fr 24:13  \fl or, \ft go beyond \f* transgress the word of the Lord to make it good or bad by myself; whatever things God shall say, them will I speak. 
\v 14 And now, behold, I return to my place; come, I will advise you of what this people shall do to your people in the last days. 
\v 15 And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says, 
\v 16 hearing the oracles of God, \f + \fr 24:16  \fl Gr. \ft knowing knowledge \f* receiving knowledge from the Most High, and having seen a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were \f + \fr 24:16  \fl Or, \ft unveiled \f* opened. 
\v 17 I will point to him, but not now; I bless him, but he draws not near: a star shall rise out of Jacob, a man shall spring out of Israel; and shall crush the princes of Moab, and shall spoil all the sons of Seth. 
\v 18 And Edom shall be an inheritance, and Esau his enemy shall be an inheritance \add of Israel\add*, and Israel wrought valiantly. 
\v 19 And \add one\add* shall arise out of Jacob, and destroy out of the city him that escapes. 
\v 20 And having seen Amalec, he took up his parable and said, Amalec \add is\add* the first of the nations; yet his seed shall perish. 
\v 21 And having seen the Kenite, he took up his parable and said, your dwelling-place \add is\add* strong; yet though you should put your nest in a rock, 
\v 22 and though Beor should have a \f + \fr 24:22  \fl Gr. \ft nest of cunning \f* skillfully contrived hiding-place, the Assyrians shall carry you away captive. 
\v 23 And he looked upon Og, and took up his parable and said, Oh, oh, who shall live, when God shall \f + \fr 24:23  \fl Gr. \ft put \f* do these things? 
\v 24 And one shall come forth from the hands of the Citians, and shall afflict Assur, and shall afflict the \f + \fr 24:24  \fl Or, \ft men of Heber. \f* Hebrews, and they shall perish together. 
\v 25 And Balaam rose up and departed and returned to his place, and Balac went \f + \fr 24:25  \fl Gr. q. d. \ft chez lui \f* to his own home. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And Israel sojourned in Sattin, and the people \f + \fr 25:1  \fqa Heb. חלל to begin and to profane etc. \f* profaned itself by going a-whoring after the daughters of Moab. 
\v 2 And they called them to the sacrifices of their idols; and the people ate of their sacrifices, and worshipped their idols. 
\v 3 And Israel consecrated themselves to Beel-phegor; and the Lord was very angry with Israel. 
\v 4 And the Lord said to Moses, Take all the princes of the people, and \f + \fr 25:4  \fl Or, \ft put them to shame. See Heb. 6.6 \f* make them examples \add of judgment\add* for the Lord in the face of the sun, and the anger of the Lord shall be turned away from Israel. 
\v 5 And Moses said to the tribes of Israel, Slay you⌃ every one his friend that is consecrated to Beel-phegor. 
\v 6 And, behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought his brother to a Madianitish woman before Moses, and before all the congregation of the children of Israel; and they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 7 And Phinees the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, and rose out of the midst of the congregation, and took a \f + \fr 25:7  \fl Gr. \ft dagger. \f* javelin in his hand, 
\v 8 and went in after the Israelitish man into the \f + \fr 25:8  \fl Gr. \ft furnace, κάμινον. Trom renders \fqa lupanar. \fl Heb. \ft הקכה. \f* chamber, and pierced them both through, both the Israelitish man, and the woman through her womb; and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
\v 9 And those that died in the plague were four and twenty thousand. 
\v 10 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has caused my wrath to cease from the children of Israel, when I was exceedingly jealous \f + \fr 25:11  \fl Or, \ft with \fl Or, \ft against them. \fl Hebraism\f* among them, and I did not consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
\v 12 Thus do you say \add to him\add*, Behold, I give him a covenant of peace: 
\v 13 and he and his seed after him shall have a perpetual covenant of priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel. 
\v 14 Now the name of the struck Israelitish man, who was struck with the Madianitish woman, \add was\add* Zambri son of Salmon, prince of a house of the tribe of Symeon. 
\v 15 And the name of the Madianitish woman who was struck, \add was\add* Chasbi, daughter of Sur, a prince of the nation of Ommoth: it is a chief house among the people of Madiam. 
\v 16 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 
\v 17 Plague the Madianites as enemies, and strike them, 
\v 18 for they are enemies to you by the treachery wherein they ensnare you through Phogor, and through Chasbi their sister, daughter of a prince of Madiam, who was struck in the day of the plague because of Phogor. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar the priest, saying, 
\v 2 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, according to the houses \f + \fr 26:2  \fl Gr. \ft of their fathers' families. \f* of their lineage, every one that goes forth \f + \fr 26:2  \fl Gr. \ft to set himself in array. \f* to battle in Israel. 
\v 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke in Araboth of Moab at the Jordan by Jericho, saying,

\p
\v 1 And the daughters of Salpaad the son of Opher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, of the tribe of Manasse, of the sons of Joseph, came near; and these were their names, Maala, and Nua, and Egla, and Melcha, and Thersa; 
\v 2 and they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes, and before all the congregation at the door of the tabernacle of witness, saying, 
\v 3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the midst of the congregation that rebelled against the Lord in the gathering of Core; for he died for his own sin, and he had no sons. Let not the name of our father be blotted out of the midst of his people, because he has no son: give us an inheritance in the midst of our father's brethren. 
\v 4 And Moses brought their case before the Lord. 
\v 5 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 6 The daughters of Salpaad have spoken rightly: you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance in the midst of their father's brethren, and you shall assign their father's inheritance to them. 
\v 7 And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 
\v 8 If a man die, and have no son, you⌃ shall assign his inheritance to his daughter. 
\v 9 And if he have no daughter, you⌃ shall give his inheritance to his brother. 
\v 10 And if he have no brethren, you⌃ shall give his inheritance to his father's brother. 
\v 11 And if there be no brethren of his father, you⌃ shall give the inheritance to his nearest relation of his tribe, to inherit his possessions; and this shall be to the children of Israel an ordinance of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
\v 12 And the Lord said to Moses, Go up to the mountain that is in the country beyond Jordan, this mount Nabau, and behold the land Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession. 
\v 13 And you shall see it, and you also shall be added to your people, as Aaron your brother was added \add to them\add* in mount Or: 
\v 14 because you⌃ transgressed my commandment in the wilderness of Sin, when the congregation resisted \add and refused\add* to sanctify me; you⌃ sanctified me not at the water before them. This is the water of Strife in Cades in the wilderness of Sin. 
\v 15 And Moses said to the Lord, 
\v 16 Let the Lord God of spirits and of all flesh look out for a man over this congregation, 
\v 17 who shall go out before them, and who shall come in before them, and who shall lead them out, and who shall bring them in; so the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep without a shepherd. 
\v 18 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take to yourself Joshua the son of Naue, a man who has the Spirit in him, and you shall lay your hands upon him. 
\v 19 And you shall set him before Eleazar the priest, and you shall give him a charge before all the congregation, and you shall give a charge concerning him before them. 
\v 20 And you shall put of your glory upon him, that the children of Israel may listen to him. 
\v 21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and they shall ask of him before the Lord the judgment of the Urim: they shall go forth at his word, and at his word they shall come in, he and the children of Israel with one accord, and all the congregation. 
\v 22 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation. 
\v 23 And he laid his hands on him, and appointed him as the Lord ordered Moses.

\v 3 And you shall say to them, These are the burnt offerings, all that you⌃ shall bring to the Lord; two lambs of a year old without blemish daily, for a whole burnt offering perpetually.

\v 1 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord commanded Moses. 
\v 2 And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This \add is\add* the thing which the Lord has commanded. 
\v 3 Whatsoever man shall vow a vow to the Lord, or swear an oath, or bind himself with an obligation upon his soul, he shall not \f + \fr 30:3  \fl Gr. \ft profane \f* break his word; all that shall come out of his mouth he shall do. 
\v 4 And if a woman shall vow a vow to the Lord, or bind herself with an obligation in her youth in her father's house; and her father should hear her vows and her obligations, wherewith she has bound her soul, and her father should hold his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, 
\v 5 and all the obligations with which she has bound her soul, shall remain to her. 
\v 6 But if her father straitly forbid \add her\add* in the day in which he shall hear all her vows and her obligations, which she has contracted upon her soul, they shall not stand; and the Lord shall hold her guiltless, because her father forbade her. 
\v 7 But if she should be indeed married, and her vows be upon her according to the utterance of her lips, \f + \fr 30:7  \ft It would seem that the relative in respect of οὓς must refer to ὸρισμοὺς, understood. \f* \add the obligations\add* which she has contracted upon her soul;

\v 10 And the vow of a widow and of her that is put away, whatever she shall \f + \fr 30:10  \fl Gr. \ft vow. \f* bind upon her soul, shall stand to her. 
\v 11 And if her vow \add be made\add* in the house of her husband, or the obligation upon her soul with an oath,

\v 13 But if her husband should utterly \f + \fr 30:13  \fl Or. \ft forbid; \fl lit. \ft take away. \f* cancel the vow in the day in which he shall hear it, none of the things which shall proceed out of her lips in her vows, and in the obligations \add contracted\add* upon her soul, shall stand to her; her husband has cancelled them, and the Lord shall hold her guiltless. 
\v 14 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict her soul, her husband shall confirm it to her, or her husband shall cancel it. 
\v 15 But if he be wholly silent at her from day to day, then shall he bind upon her all her vows; and he shall confirm to her the obligations \add which she has bound\add* upon herself, because he held his peace at her in the day in which he heard her.

\v 4 Send a thousand of each tribe from all the tribes of the children of Israel to set themselves in array. 
\v 5 And they numbered of the thousands of Israel a thousand of \add each\add* tribe, twelve thousands; \add these were\add* armed for war. 
\v 6 And Moses sent them away a thousand of every tribe with their forces, and Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: and the holy instruments, and the signal trumpets \add were\add* in their hands. 
\v 7 And they set themselves in array against Madian, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they killed every male. 
\v 8 And they killed the kings of Madian together with their slain \add subjects\add*; even Evi and Rocon, and Sur, and Ur, and Roboc, five kings of Madian; and they killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor with their \add other\add* slain. 
\v 9 And they made a prey of the women of Madian, and their store, and their cattle, and all their possessions: and they spoiled their forces. 
\v 10 And they burnt with fire all their cities in the places of their habitation and they burnt their villages with fire. 
\v 11 And they took all their plunder, and all their spoils, both man and beast. 
\v 12 And they brought to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to all the children of Israel, the captives, and the spoils, and the plunder, to the camp to Araboth Moab, which is at Jordan by Jericho. 
\v 13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the rulers of the synagogue went forth out of the camp to meet them. 
\v 14 And Moses was angry with the captains of the host, the heads of thousands and the heads of hundreds who came from the battle-array. 
\v 15 And Moses said to them, Why have you⌃ saved every female alive? 
\v 16 For they were \add the occasion\add* to the children of Israel by the word of Balaam of their revolting and despising the word of the Lord, because of Phogor; and there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord. 
\v 17 Now then kill every male in all the spoil, kill every woman, who has known the lying with man. 
\v 18 And as for all the captivity of women, who have not known the lying with man, save you⌃ them alive.

\v 21 And Eleazar the priest said to the men of the host that came from the battle-array, This \add is\add* the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded Moses. 
\v 22 Beside the gold, and the silver, and the brass, and the iron, and lead, and tin,

\v 24 And on the seventh day you⌃ shall wash your garments, and be clean; and afterwards you⌃ shall come into the camp. 
\v 25 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 26 Take the sum of the spoils of the captivity both of man and beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the families of the congregation. 
\v 27 And you⌃ shall divide the spoils between the warriors that went out to battle, and the whole congregation. 
\v 28 And you⌃ shall take a tribute for the Lord from the warriors that went out to battle; one soul out of five hundred, from the men, and from the cattle, even from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the asses; and you⌃ shall take from their half.

\v 32 And that which remained of the spoil which the warriors took, was—of the sheep, six hundred and seventy-five thousand: 
\v 33 and oxen, seventy-two thousand:

\v 35 And persons of women who had not known lying with man, all the souls, thirty-two thousand. 
\v 36 And the half, \add even\add* the portion of them that went out to war, from the number of the sheep, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred. 
\v 37 And the tribute to the Lord from the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.

\v 39 And asses, thirty thousand and five hundred, and the tribute to the Lord, sixty-one: 
\v 40 and the persons, sixteen thousand, and the tribute of them to the Lord, thirty-two souls. 
\v 41 And Moses gave the tribute to the Lord, the heave-offering of God, to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses; 
\v 42 from the half belonging to the children of Israel, whom Moses separated from the men of war. 
\v 43 And the half \add taken\add* from the sheep, belonging to the congregation, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred. 
\v 44 And the oxen, thirty-six thousand;

\v 49 Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war with us, and not one is missing. 
\v 50 And we have brought our gift to the Lord, \add every\add* man who has found an article of gold, whether an armlet, or a chain, or a ring, or a bracelet, or a clasp for hair, to make atonement for us before the Lord. 
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even every wrought article. 
\v 52 And all the wrought gold, even the offering that they offered to the Lord, was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds. 
\v 53 For the men of war took plunder every one for himself. 
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and brought the \f + \fr 31:54  \fl Gr. \ft them. \f* vessels into the tabernacle of witness, a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord.

\v 1 And the children of Ruben and the children of Gad had \f + \fr 32:1  \fl Gr. \ft cattle, a multitude, greatly a multitude. \f* a multitude of cattle, very great; and they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Galaad; and the place was a place for cattle: 
\v 2 and the children of Ruben and the children of Gad came, and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, 
\v 3 Ataroth, and Daebon, and Jazer, and Namra, and Esebon, and Eleale, and Sebama, and Nabau, and Baean, 
\v 4 the land which the Lord has delivered up before the children of Israel, is pasture land, and your servants have cattle. 
\v 5 And they said, If we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and do not cause us to pass over Jordan. 
\v 6 And Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall you⌃ sit here? 
\v 7 And why do you⌃ pervert the minds of the children of Israel, that they should not cross over into the land, which the Lord gives them? 
\v 8 Did not your fathers thus, when I sent them from Cades Barne to spy out the land? 
\v 9 And they went up to the valley of the cluster, and spied the land, and turned aside the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land, which the Lord gave them. 
\v 10 And the Lord was very angry in that day, and swore, saying, 
\v 11 Surely these men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward, who know good and evil, shall not see the land which I swore \add to give\add* to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, for they have not closely followed after me: 
\v 12 save Caleb the son of Jephonne, who was set apart, and Joshua the son of Naue, for they closely followed after the Lord. 
\v 13 And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and for forty years he caused them to wander in the wilderness, until all the generation which did evil \f + \fr 32:13  \fl Or, \ft before. \f* in the sight of the Lord was extinct. 
\v 14 Behold, you⌃ are risen up in the room of your fathers, a \f + \fr 32:14  \fl Or, \ft an evil race, \fl lit \ft a destruction, but some read, σύστρεμμα. \f* combination of sinful men, to increase yet farther the fierce wrath of the Lord against Israel. 
\v 15 For you⌃ will turn away from him to desert him yet once more in the wilderness, and you⌃ will sin against this whole congregation. 
\v 16 And they came to him, and said, We will build here folds for our cattle, and cities for our possessions; 
\v 17 and we will arm ourselves and go as an advanced guard before the children of Israel, until we shall have brought them into their place; and our possessions shall remain in walled cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 18 We will not return to our houses till the children of Israel shall have been distributed, each to his own inheritance. 
\v 19 And we will not any longer inherit with them from the other side of Jordan and onwards, because we have our full inheritance on the side beyond Jordan eastward. 
\v 20 And Moses said to them, If you⌃ will do according to \f + \fr 32:20  \fl Gr. \ft this word. \f* these words, if you⌃ will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle, 
\v 21 and every one of you will pass over Jordan fully armed before the Lord, until his enemy be destroyed from before his face, 
\v 22 and the land shall be subdued before the Lord, then afterwards you⌃ shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and as regards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before the Lord. 
\v 23 But if you⌃ will not do so, you⌃ will sin against the Lord; and you⌃ shall know your sin, when afflictions shall come upon you. 
\v 24 And you⌃ shall build for yourselves cities for your store, and folds for your cattle; and you⌃ shall do that which proceeds out of your mouth. 
\v 25 And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as our lord commands. 
\v 26 Our store, and our wives, and all our cattle shall be in the cities of Galaad. 
\v 27 But your servants will go over all armed and set in order before the Lord to battle, as \add our\add* lord says. 
\v 28 And Moses appointed to them \add for judges\add* Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Naue, and the chiefs of the families of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 29 And Moses said to them, If the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad will pass over Jordan with you, every one armed for war before the Lord, and you⌃ shall subdue the land before you, then you⌃ shall give to them the land of Galaad for a possession. 
\v 30 But if they will not pass over armed with you to war before the Lord, then shall you⌃ cause to pass over their possessions and their wives and their cattle before you into the land of Chanaan, and they shall inherit with you in the land of Chanaan. 
\v 31 And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad answered, saying, Whatsoever \f + \fr 32:31  \fl Or, \ft our Lord, or, our master, \fl i. e. \ft Moses. \f* the Lord says to his servants, that will we do. 
\v 32 We will go over armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan, and you⌃ shall give us our inheritance beyond Jordan. 
\v 33 And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasse of the sons of Joseph, the kingdom of Seon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, the land and \f + \fr 32:33  \fl Gr. \ft the cities. \f* its cities with its coasts, the cities of the land round about. 
\v 34 And the sons of Gad built Daebon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
\v 35 and Sophar, and Jazer, and they set them up, 
\v 36 and Namram, and Baetharan, strong cities, and folds for sheep. 
\v 37 And the sons of Ruben built Esebon, and Eleale, and Kariatham, 
\v 38 and Beelmeon, surrounded \add with walls\add*, and Sebama; and they called the names of the cities which they built, after their own names. 
\v 39 And a son of Machir the son of Manasse went to Galaad, and took it, and destroyed the Amorite who lived in it. 
\v 40 And Moses gave Galaad to Machir the son of Manasse, and he lived there. 
\v 41 And Jair the \add son\add* of Manasse went and took their \f + \fr 32:41  \fl Or, \ft folds. \f* villages, and called them the villages of Jair. 
\v 42 And Nabau went and took Caath and her villages, and called them Naboth after his name.

\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Moses to the west of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

\v 16 And if he should strike him with an iron instrument, and the man should die, he is a murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death.

\v 25 And the congregation shall rescue the slayer from the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he fled for refuge; and he shall dwell there till the death of the high-priest, whom they anointed with the holy oil. 
\v 26 But if the slayer should in any wise go out beyond the bounds of the city whither he fled for refuge,

\v 1 And the heads of the tribe of the sons of Galaad the son of Machir the son of Manasse, of the tribe of the sons of Joseph, drew near, and spoke before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the heads of the houses of the families of the children of Israel: 
\v 2 and they said, The Lord commanded our lord to render the land of inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and the Lord appointed our lord to give the inheritance of Salpaad our brother to his daughters. 
\v 3 And they will become wives in one of the tribes of the children of Israel; so their inheritance shall be taken away from the possession of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which the women shall marry, and shall be taken away from the portion of our inheritance. 
\v 4 And if there shall be a release of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which the women marry, and their inheritance, shall be taken away from the inheritance of our family's tribe. 
\v 5 And Moses charged the children of Israel by the commandment of the Lord, saying, Thus \f + \fr 36:5  \fl Gr. \ft say. \f* says the tribe of the children of Joseph. 
\v 6 This \add is\add* the thing which the Lord has appointed the daughters of Salpaad, saying, Let them \f + \fr 36:6  \fl Gr. \ft be wives. \f* marry where they please, only let them marry \add men\add* of their father's tribe. 
\v 7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel go about from tribe to tribe, for the children of Israel shall \f + \fr 36:7  \fl Gr. \ft be cemented. See Matt. 19:5; Acts 5:26. \f* steadfastly continue each in the inheritance of his family's tribe. 
\v 8 And whatever daughter is heiress to a property of the tribes of the children Israel, \add such\add* women shall be married each to one of her father's tribe, that the sons of Israel may each inherit the property of his father's tribe. 
\v 9 And the inheritance shall not go about from one tribe to another, but the children of Israel shall steadfastly continue each in his own inheritance. 
\v 10 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did they to the daughters of Salpaad. 
\v 11 So Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Nua, and Malaa, the daughters of Salpaad, married their cousins; 
\v 12 they were married \add to men\add* of the tribe of Manasse of the sons of Joseph; and their inheritance was attached to the tribe of their father's family. 
\v 13 These \add are\add* the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, at the west of Moab, at Jordan by Jericho.
