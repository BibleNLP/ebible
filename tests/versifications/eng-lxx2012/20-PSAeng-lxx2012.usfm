\c 1  
\q1
\v 1 Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of \f + \fr 1:1  \fl Gr. \ft pestilent. \f* evil men. 
\q1
\v 2 But his \f + \fr 1:2  \fl Gr. \ft will. \f* pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day and night. 
\q1
\v 3 And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatever he shall do shall be prospered. 
\q1
\v 4 Not so the ungodly; —not so: but rather as the \f + \fr 1:4  \fl Or. \ft dust or down. \f* chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just. 
\q1
\v 6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. 
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1  \x + \xo 2:1  \xt Acts 4:25 \x* Therefore did the heathen rage, and the nations imagine vain things? 
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, against the Lord, and against his Christ; 
\q1
\v 3  \add saying\add*, Let us break through their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us. 
\q1
\v 4 He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. 
\q1
\v 5 Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury. 
\q1
\v 6 But I have been made king by him on Sion his holy mountain, 
\q1
\v 7 declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me, \x + \xo 2:7  \xt Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5 \x* You are my Son, today have I begotten you. 
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen \add for\add* your inheritance, and the ends of the earth \add for\add* your possession. 
\q1
\v 9 You shall \f + \fr 2:9  \fl Gr. \ft tend them as a shepherd. Rev. 2:27. \f* rule them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel. 
\q1
\v 10 Now therefore understand, you⌃ kings: be instructed, all you⌃ that judge the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling. 
\q1
\v 12  \f + \fr 2:12  \fl Note. \ft - This rendering or a similar one the Jews maintain. \f* Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you⌃ should perish from the righteous way: whenever his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that trust in him. 
\c 3  
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me. 
\q1
\v 2 Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. \f + \fr 3:2  \ft The word Διάψαλμα (Selah) has been rendered Pause, as most intelligible to the English reader. \f* Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 But you, O Lord, are my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head. 
\q1
\v 4 I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. 
\q1
\v 5 I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. 
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. 
\q1
\v 7 Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for you have struck all who were without cause my enemies; you have broken the teeth of sinners. 
\q1
\v 8 Deliverance is the Lord's, and your blessing is upon your people. 
\c 4  
\d For the End, a Song of David among \add the \add*Psalms. 
\q1
\v 1 When I called upon \add him\add*, the God of my righteousness heard me: you have made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and listen to my prayer. 
\q1
\v 2 O you⌃ sons of men, how long \add will you⌃ be\add* \f + \fr 4:2  \fl Lit. \ft heavy of heart. \f* slow of heart? therefore do you⌃ love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 But know you⌃ that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. 
\q1
\v 4  \x + \xo 4:4  \xt Eph 4:26 \x* Be you⌃ angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what you⌃ say in your hearts. Pause. 
\q1
\v 5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 6 Many say, Who will show us good things? the light of your countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us. 
\q1
\v 7 You have put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil. 
\q1
\v 8 I will \f + \fr 4:8  \fl Or. \ft at the same time. \f* both lie down in peace and sleep: for you, Lord, only have caused me to dwell securely. 
\c 5  
\d For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits. 
\q1
\v 1 Listen to my words, O Lord, \f + \fr 5:1  \fl Lit. \ft understand. \f* attend to my cry. 
\q1
\v 2 Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to you, O Lord, will I pray. 
\q1
\v 3 In the morning you shall hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon you, and will look up. 
\q1
\v 4 For you are not a god that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with you. 
\q1
\v 5 Neither shall the transgressors continue in your sight: you hate, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. 
\q1
\v 6 You will destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. 
\q1
\v 7 But I will enter into your house in the multitude of your mercy: I will worship in your fear toward your holy temple. 
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make my way plain before your face. 
\q1
\v 9 For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their \x + \xo 5:9  \xt Rom 3:13 \x* throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit. 
\q1
\v 10 Judge them, O God; let them \f + \fr 5:10  \fl Gr. \ft fall from, \fl or, \ft by reason of. \f* fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked you, O Lord. 
\q1
\v 11 But let all that trust on you be glad in you: they shall exult for ever, and you shall dwell among them; and all that love your name shall rejoice in you. 
\q1
\v 12 For you, Lord, shall bless the righteous: you have \f + \fr 5:12  \fl Lit. \ft crowned. \f* compassed us as with a shield of favor. 
\c 6  
\d For the End, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, neither chasten me in your anger. 
\q1
\v 2 Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed. 
\q1
\v 3 My soul also is grievously vexed: but you, O Lord, how long? 
\q1
\v 4 Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for your mercy's sake. 
\q1
\v 5 For in death no man remembers you: and who will give you thanks in Hades? 
\q1
\v 6  \f + \fr 6:6  \fl Gr. \ft I have laboured. \f* I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with tears. 
\q1
\v 7 My eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies. 
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all you⌃ that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 
\q1
\v 9 The Lord has listened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
\q1
\v 10 Let all my enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily. 
\c 7  
\d A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the \f + \fr 7:0  \fl Lit. \ft son of Jemini. \f* Benjamite. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord my God, in you have I trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. 
\q1
\v 2 Lest at any time \add the enemy\add* seize my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. 
\q1
\v 3 O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is unrighteousness in my hands;) 
\q1
\v 4 if I have requited with evil those who requited me \add with good\add*; may I then perish empty by means of my enemies. 
\q1
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; and let him trample my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. 
\q1
\v 6 Arise, O Lord, in your wrath; be exalted \f + \fr 7:6  \fqa Heb. 'because of my enemies.' \f* in the utmost boundaries of my enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the decree which you did command. 
\q1
\v 7 And the congregation of the nations shall compass you: and for this cause do you return on high. 
\q1
\v 8 The Lord shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my innocence that is in me. 
\q1
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and \add then\add* you shall direct the righteous, O God that search the hearts and reins. 
\q1
\v 10 My help is righteous, \add coming\add* from God who saves the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting vengeance every day. 
\q1
\v 12 If you⌃ will not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready. 
\q1
\v 13 And on it he has fitted the instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the \f + \fr 7:13  \ft See \fqa Heb. perhaps 'persecuting ones.' \f* raging ones. 
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. 
\q1
\v 15 He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall fall into the ditch which he has made. 
\q1
\v 16 His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown. 
\q1
\v 17 I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 8  
\d For the end, concerning the wine presses, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is your name in all the earth! for your magnificence is exalted above the heavens. 
\q1
\v 2  \x + \xo 8:2  \xt Matt 21:16 \x* Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you perfected praise, because of your enemies; that you might put down the enemy and avenger. 
\q1
\v 3 For I will regard the heavens, the work of your fingers; the moon and stars, which you have established. 
\q1
\v 4  \x + \xo 8:4  \xt Heb 2:6-9 \x* What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man, that you visit him? 
\q1
\v 5 You made him a little less than angels, you have crowned him with glory and honor; 
\q1
\v 6 and you have set him over the works of your hands: you have put all things under his feet: 
\q1
\v 7 sheep and all \f + \fr 8:7  \fl Gr. \ft cows. \f* oxen, yes and the cattle of the field; 
\q1
\v 8 the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the \add creatures\add* passing through the paths of the sea. 
\q1
\v 9 O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is your name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\d For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the secrets of the Son. 
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will recount all your wonderful works. 
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and exult in you: I will sing to your name, O you Most High. 
\q1
\v 3 When my enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at your presence. 
\q1
\v 4 For you have maintained my cause and my right; you sat on the throne, that judge righteousness. 
\q1
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; you have blotted out their name for ever, even for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 6 The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and you have destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, 
\q1
\v 7 but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. 
\q1
\v 8 And he will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. 
\q1
\v 9 The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a seasonable help, in affliction. 
\q1
\v 10 And let them that know your name hope in you: for you, O Lord, have not failed them that diligently seek you. 
\q1
\v 11 Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion: declare his dealings among the nations. 
\q1
\v 12 For he remembered them, \add in\add* making inquisition for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. 
\q1
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction \add which I suffer\add* of my enemies, you that lift me up from the gates of death: 
\q1
\v 14 that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in your salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken. 
\q1
\v 16 The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. A song of Pause. 
\q1
\v 17 Let sinners be driven away into Hades, \add even\add* all the nations that forget God. 
\q1
\v 18 For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before you. 
\q1
\v 20 Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are men. Pause.

\q1 (Psalm 9a\f + \fr 9:20  \fl Note. \ft - Here begins a change of numbers as compared with the \fqa Heb. which continues to Ps. 146, this psalm having no number, and the eleventh being called the tenth. The following verses 21-37 are numbered 1-18 in the original text. \f*) 
\v 21 Why stand you afar off, O Lord? \add why\add* do you overlook \add us\add* in times of need, in affliction? 
\q1
\v 22 While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is \f + \fr 9:22  \fl Gr. \ft inflamed, as in a fever. \f* hotly pursued: \add the wicked\add* are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. 
\q1
\v 23 Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. 
\q1
\v 24 The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his \f + \fr 9:24  \fl Or, \ft anger. \f* pride he will not seek after \add him\add*: God is not before him. 
\q1
\v 25 His ways are \f + \fr 9:25  \fl Gr. \ft profaned. \f* profane at all times; your judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. 
\q1
\v 26 For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, \add continuing\add* without evil from generation to generation. \x + \xo 9:26  \xt Rom 8:14 \x* 
\q1
\v 27 Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. 
\q1
\v 28 He lies in wait with rich \add men\add* in secret places, in order to kill the innocent: his eyes are \f + \fr 9:28  \fl Gr. \ft look. \f* set against the poor. 
\q1
\v 29 He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him \add after him\add*: he will bring him down in his snare. 
\q1
\v 30 He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. 
\q1
\v 31 For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look. 
\q1
\v 32 Arise, O Lord God; let your hand be lifted up: forget not the poor. 
\q1
\v 33 Therefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will not require \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 34 You see \add it\add*; for you do observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into your hands: the poor has been left to you; you were a helper to the orphan. 
\q1
\v 35 Break you the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. 
\q1
\v 36 The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: you⌃ Gentiles shall perish out his land. 
\q1
\v 37 The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: your ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart; 
\q1
\v 38 to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast upon the earth. 
\c 10  
\d (11 in KJV) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 In the Lord I have put my trust: how will you⌃ say to my soul, 
\q1
\v 2 Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? 
\q1
\v 3 For behold the sinners have bent their \add bow\add*, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot \f + \fr 10:3  \fl Gr. \ft in dark moon, or little moonlight, \fl q. d. \ft luce malignâ \f*privily at the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 4 For they have pulled down what you did frame, but what has the righteous done? 
\q1
\v 5 The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men. 
\q1
\v 6 The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. 
\q1
\v 7 He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast \add shall be\add* the portion of their cup. 
\q1
\v 8 For the Lord \add is\add* righteous, and loves \f + \fr 10:8  \fl Gr. \ft righteousnesses\f*righteousness; his face beholds uprightness. 
\c 11  
\d (12) For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth. 
\q1
\v 1 Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for \f + \fr 11:1  \fl Gr. \ft truths are become rare \f* truth is diminished from among the children of men. 
\q1
\v 2 Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbor: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: 
\q1
\v 4 who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? 
\q1
\v 5 Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the Lord, I will set \add them\add* in safety; I will speak \add to them\add* thereof openly. 
\q1
\v 6 The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved \add in\add* \f + \fr 11:6  \fl Gr. \ft the earth. \f* a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
\q1
\v 7 You, O Lord, shall keep us, and shall preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. 
\q1
\v 8 The ungodly walk around: according to your greatness you have greatly exalted the sons of men. 
\c 12  
\d (13) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 How long, O Lord, will you forget me? for ever? how long will you turn away your face from me? 
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
\q1
\v 3 Look on me, listen to me, O Lord my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
\q1
\v 4 lest at any time my enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. 
\q1
\v 5 But I have hoped in your mercy; my heart shall exult in your salvation. 
\q1
\v 6 I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 13  
\d (14) For the end, Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after god. 
\q1
\v 3 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. 
\q1
\v 4 Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord. 
\q1
\v 5 There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. 
\q1
\v 6 You⌃ have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope. 
\q1
\v 7 Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad. 
\c 14  
\d (15) A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tabernacle? and who shall dwell in your holy mountain? 
\q1
\v 2 He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Who has not spoken craftily with his tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbor, nor taken up a reproach against them that lived nearest to him. 
\q1
\v 4 In his sight an evil-worker is set at nothing, but he honors them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbor, and disappoints \add him\add* not. 
\q1
\v 5 He has not \f + \fr 14:5  \fl Gr. \ft given. \f* lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved. 
\c 15  
\d (16) A writing of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in you. 
\q1
\v 2 I said to the Lord, You are my Lord; for you have no need of my \f + \fr 15:2  \fl Gr. \ft good deeds, or things. \f* goodness. 
\q1
\v 3 On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them. 
\q1
\v 4 Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with my lips. 
\q1
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you are he that restores my inheritance to me. 
\q1
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in the best places, yes, I have a most excellent heritage. 
\q1
\v 7 I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me even \f + \fr 15:7  \fl Possibly, \ft during the night. \fl q. d. \ft as long as night lasted. \f* till night. 
\q1
\v 8 I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. 
\q1
\v 9 Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
\q1
\v 10 because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither \x + \xo 15:10  \xt Rom 13:35 \x* will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption. 
\q1
\v 11 You have made known to me the ways of life; you will fill me with joy with your countenance: at your right hand \add there are\add* delights for ever. 
\c 16  
\d (17) A prayer of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Listen, O Lord \f + \fr 16:1  \fl Or, \ft to my righteous plea, etc. \f* of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not \add uttered\add* with deceitful lips. 
\q1
\v 2 Let my judgment come forth from your presence; let my eyes behold righteousness. 
\q1
\v 3 You have tested my heart; you have visited \add me\add* by night; you have tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: \add I am purposed\add* that my mouth shall not speak \add amiss\add*. 
\q1
\v 4 As for the works of men, by the words of your lips I have \f + \fr 16:4  \fl Lit. \ft I have observed hard ways. \f* guarded \add myself from\add* hard ways. 
\q1
\v 5 Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps slip not. 
\q1
\v 6 I have cried, for you heard me, O God: incline your ear to me, and listen to my words. 
\q1
\v 7 Show the marvels of your mercies, you that save them that hope in you. 
\q1
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist your right hand: you shall screen me by the covering of your wings, 
\q1
\v 9 from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: my enemies have compassed about my soul. 
\q1
\v 10 They have enclosed \add themselves with\add* their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. 
\q1
\v 11 They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes \add so as\add* to bow them down to the ground. 
\q1
\v 12 They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret \add places\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: \add draw\add* your sword, 
\q1
\v 14 because of the enemies of your hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with your hidden \add treasures\add*: they have been satisfied with \f + \fr 16:14  \fl Alex. \ft children. \f* uncleanness, and have left the remnant \add of their possessions\add* to their babes.

\d (18) For the end, \add a Psalm\add* of David, the servant of the Lord; \add the words\add* which he spoke to the Lord, \add even\add* the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out the hand of all his enemies, and out the hand of Saul: and he said: 
\q1
\v 1 I will love you, O Lord, my strength. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; \add he is\add* my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. 
\q1
\v 3 I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from my enemies. 
\q1
\v 4 The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. 
\q1
\v 5 The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. 
\q1
\v 6 And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, \add even\add* into his ears. 
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them. 
\q1
\v 8 There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. 
\q1
\v 9 And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. 
\q1
\v 10 And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. 
\q1
\v 11 And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, \add even\add* dark water in the clouds of the air. 
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. 
\q1
\v 14 And he sent forth \add his\add* weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them. 
\q1
\v 15 And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your wrath. 
\q1
\v 16 He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. 
\q1
\v 17 He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I. 
\q1
\v 18 They prevented me in the day of my affliction: but the Lord was my stay against \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 19 And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. 
\q1
\v 20 And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me. 
\q1
\v 21 For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\q1
\v 22 For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me. 
\q1
\v 23 And I shall be blameless with him, and shall keep myself from my iniquity. 
\q1
\v 24 And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. 
\q1
\v 25 With the holy you will be holy; and with the innocent man you will be innocent. 
\q1
\v 26 And with the excellent \add man\add* you will be excellent; and with the perverse you will show frowardness. 
\q1
\v 27 For you will save the lowly people, and will humble the eyes of the proud. 
\q1
\v 28 For you, O Lord, will light my lamp: my God, you will lighten my darkness. 
\q1
\v 29 For by you shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. 
\q1
\v 30  \add As for\add* my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him. 
\q1
\v 31 For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God? 
\q1
\v 32  \add It is\add* God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: 
\q1
\v 33 who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places. 
\q1
\v 34 He instructs my hands for war: and you have made my arms \add as\add* a brazen bow. 
\q1
\v 35 And you have made me \f + \fr 17:35  \fl Gr. \ft the protection of. \f* secure in my salvation: and your right hand has helped me, and your correction has upheld me to the end; yes, your correction itself shall instruct me. 
\q1
\v 36 You have made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail. 
\q1
\v 37 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed. 
\q1
\v 38 I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet. 
\q1
\v 39 For you have girded me with strength for war: you have beaten down under me all that rose up against me. 
\q1
\v 40 And you have made my enemies turn their backs before me; and you have destroyed them that hated me. 
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but there was no deliverer: \add even\add* to the Lord, but he listened not to them. 
\q1
\v 42 I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind. 
\q1
\v 43 Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: you shall make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me, 
\q1
\v 44 at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children \f + \fr 17:44  \fl Or, \ft feigned obedience. \f* lied to me. 
\q1
\v 45 The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through lameness. 
\q1

\q1
\v 1 O Lord, the king shall rejoice in your strength; and in your salvation he shall greatly exult. 
\q1
\v 2 You have granted him the desire of his soul, and have not withheld from him the request of his lips. Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 For you have prevented him with blessings of goodness: you have set upon his head a crown of precious stone. 
\q1
\v 4 He asked life of you, and you gave him length of days for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 5 His glory is great in your salvation: you will crown him with glory and majesty. 
\q1
\v 6 For you will give him a blessing for ever and ever: you will gladden him with joy with your countenance.

\v 7 For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved.

\v 15 My strength is dried up, like a potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and you have brought me down to the dust of death.

\q1
\v 3 O Lord, you have brought up my soul from Hades, you have delivered me from \add among\add* them that go down to the pit. 
\q1
\v 4 Sing to the Lord, you⌃ his saints, and give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness. 
\q1
\v 5 For anger is in his wrath, but life in his favor: weeping shall wait for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning. 
\q1
\v 6 And I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
\q1
\v 7 O Lord, in your good pleasure you did add strength to my beauty: but you did turn away your face, and I was troubled. 
\q1
\v 8 To you, O Lord, will I cry; and to my God will I make supplication. 
\q1
\v 9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to you? or shall it declare your truth? 
\q1
\v 10 The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my helper. 
\q1
\v 11 You have turned my mourning into joy for me: you have torn off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

\q1
\v 3 For you are my strength and my refuge; and you shall guide me for your name's sake, and maintain me. 
\q1
\v 4 You shall bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for you, O Lord, are my defender. 
\q1
\v 5 Into your hands I will commit my spirit: you have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth. 
\q1
\v 6 You have hated them that idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 7 I will exult and be glad in your mercy: for you have looked upon my affliction; you have saved my soul from distresses. 
\q1
\v 8 And you have not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: you have set my feet in a wide place. 
\q1
\v 9 Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and by belly. 
\q1
\v 10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled. 
\q1
\v 11 I became a reproach among all my enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. 
\q1
\v 12 I have been forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am become as a broken vessel. 
\q1
\v 13 For I heard the slander of many that lived round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life. 
\q1
\v 14 But I hoped in you, O Lord: I said, You are my God. 
\q1
\v 15 My lots are in your hands: deliver me from the hand of my enemies,

\v 17 O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon you: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades. 
\q1
\v 18 Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn.

\q1
\v 20 You will hide them in the secret of your presence from the vexation of man: you will screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. 
\q1
\v 21 Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city. 
\q1
\v 22 But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of your eyes: therefore you did listen, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to you. 
\q1
\v 23 Love the Lord, all you⌃ his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders \add a reward\add* to them that deal very proudly.

\q1
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, and an angel of the Lord persecuting them.

\q1
\v 1 The transgressor, that he may sin, says within himself, \add that\add* \x + \xo 35:1  \xt Rom 3:18 \x* there is no fear of God before his eyes.

\q1
\v 3 The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand \add how\add* to do good.

\v 4 He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil. 
\q1
\v 5 O Lord, your mercy is in the heaven; and your truth \add reaches\add* to the clouds. 
\q1
\v 6 Your righteousness is as the \f + \fr 35:6  \fl Or, \ft vast mountains. \f* mountains of God, your judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, you will preserve men and beasts.

\q1
\v 8 They shall be \f + \fr 35:8  \fl Gr. \ft intoxicated. \f* fully satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall cause them to drink of the full stream of your delights.

\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we shall see light. 
\q1
\v 10 Extend your mercy to them that know you; and your righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners move me.

\d (37) \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Fret not yourself because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity. 
\q1
\v 2 For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs. 
\q1
\v 3 Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the land, and you shall be fed with the wealth of it. 
\q1
\v 4 Delight \add yourself\add* in the Lord; and he shall grant you the requests of your heart. 
\q1
\v 5 Disclose your way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring \add it\add* to pass. 
\q1
\v 6 And he shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noon-day. 
\q1
\v 7 Submit yourself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not yourself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds. 
\q1
\v 8 ease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not yourself so as to do evil. 
\q1
\v 9 For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. 
\q1
\v 10 And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and you shall seek for his place, and shall not find \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight \add themselves\add* in the abundance of peace. 
\q1
\v 12 The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him. 
\q1
\v 13 But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come. 
\q1
\v 14 Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, \add and\add* to kill the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 15 Let their sword enter into their \add own\add* heart, and their bows be broken. 
\q1
\v 16 A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners. 
\q1
\v 17 For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous. 
\q1
\v 18 The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied. 
\q1
\v 20 For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honored and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke. 
\q1
\v 21 The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives. 
\q1
\v 22 For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 23 The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way. 
\q1
\v 24 When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand. 
\q1
\v 25 I was \add once\add* young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. 
\q1
\v 26 He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be \f + \fr 36:26  \fl Gr. \ft for a blessing. \f* blessed. 
\q1
\v 27 Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever. 
\q1
\v 28 For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be \f + \fr 36:28  \fl Or, \ft cleared in judgement. \f* avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 29 But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. 
\q1
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment. 
\q1
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not \f + \fr 36:31  \fl Gr. \ft be tripped up, or supplanted. \f* slide. 
\q1
\v 32 The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him. 
\q1
\v 33 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged. 
\q1
\v 34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt you to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, you shall see \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 35 I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus. 
\q1
\v 36 Yet I passed by, and behold! he was not: and I sought him, but his place was not found. 
\q1
\v 37 Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceful man. 
\q1
\v 38 But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\q1
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of affliction. 
\q1
\v 40 And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him.

\q1
\v 3 For there is no health in my flesh because of your anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins. 
\q1
\v 4 For my transgressions have gone over my head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden. 
\q1
\v 5 My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. 
\q1
\v 6 I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day.

\v 7 For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. 
\q1
\v 8 I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart. 
\q1
\v 9 But all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hidden from you.

\v 10 My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of my eyes is not with me.

\v 12 While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day. 
\q1
\v 13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. 
\q1
\v 14 And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. 
\q1
\v 15 For I hoped in you, O Lord: you will hear, O Lord my God. 
\q1
\v 16 For I said, Lest my enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me. 
\q1
\v 17 For I am ready for \f + \fr 37:17  \fl Gr. \ft scourges. \f* plagues, and my grief is continually before me.

\q1
\v 20 They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness.

\v 7 And now what \add is\add* my expectation? \add is it\add* not the Lord? and my ground \add of hope\add* is with you. Pause.

\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: you have made me a reproach to the foolish.

\v 9 I was \f + \fr 38:9  \fl Gr. \ft made dumb. \f* dumb, and opened not my mouth; for you are he that made me. 
\q1
\v 10 Remove your scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of the strength of your hand. 
\q1
\v 11 You chasten man with rebukes for iniquity, and you make his life to consume away like a spider's web; nay, every man is disquieted in vain. Pause. 
\q1
\v 12 O Lord, listen to my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers \add were\add*.

\v 13 Spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart, and be no more. 
\c 39  
\d (40) For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he attended to me, and listened to my supplication. 
\q1
\v 2 And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright. 
\q1
\v 3 And he put a new song into my mouth, \add even\add* a hymn to our God: many shall see \add it\add*, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 4 Blessed \add is\add* the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and \add who\add* has not regarded vanities and false frenzies. 
\q1
\v 5 O Lord my God, you have multiplied your wonderful works, and in your thoughts there is none who shall be likened to you: I declared and spoke \add of them\add*: they exceeded number. 
\q1
\v 6  \x + \xo 39:6  \xt Heb 10:5-6 \x* Sacrifice and offering you would not; but a body have you prepared me: whole burnt offering and \add sacrifice\add* for sin you did not require.

\v 7 Then I said, Behold, I \f + \fr 39:7  \fl Or, \ft am come. \f* come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me, 
\q1
\v 8 I desired to do your will, O my God, and your law in the midst of my heart. 
\q1
\v 9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; behold! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, you know my righteousness. 
\q1
\v 10 I have not hid your truth within my heart, and I have declared your salvation; I have not hid your mercy and your truth from the great congregation. 
\q1
\v 11 But you, Lord, remove not your compassion far from me; your mercy and your truth have helped me continually. 
\q1
\v 12 For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. 
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw near to help me. 
\q1
\v 14 Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame. 
\q1
\v 15 Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward. 
\q1
\v 16 Let all those that seek you, O Lord, exult and rejoice in you; and let them that love your salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified. 
\q1
\v 17 But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; you are my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not. 
\c 40  
\d (41) For the end, a Psalm of David.

\v 1 Blessed \add is the man\add* who thinks, on the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day. 
\q1
\v 2 May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. 
\q1
\v 3 May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; you have made all his bed in his sickness. 
\q1
\v 4 I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against you. 
\q1
\v 5 Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, \add saying\add*, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
\q1
\v 6 And if he came to see \add me\add*, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner. 
\q1
\v 7 All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. 
\q1
\v 8 They denounced a wicked word against me, \add saying\add*, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? 
\q1
\v 9 For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, \x + \xo 40:9  \xt John 13:18 \x* who ate my bread, lifted up \add his\add* heel against me. 
\q1
\v 10 But you, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. 
\q1
\v 11 By this I know that you have delighted in me, because my enemy shall not rejoice over me. 
\q1
\v 12 But you did help me because of \add my\add* innocence, and have established me before you for ever.

\q1
\v 1 As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for you, O God. 
\q1
\v 2 My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
\q1
\v 3 My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where is your God? 
\q1
\v 4 I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of your wondrous tabernacle, \add even\add* to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival. \f + \fr 41:4  \ft There are several difficulties connected with this passage. In the first place it seems evident that the LXX. read בסך, and the English translators בסר, or something similar. The Hebrew Text (to which no קרי is appended) thus far favours the LXX.; who, however, appear to have read אררס as a part of ארר, and made an adjective of it. Again, τόπῳ has nothing immediately answering it in the Hebrew, and may be accounted for on the principle so often referred to of \fl double translation.\f* 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; \add he is\add* the salvation of my countenance. 
\q1
\v 6 O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill. 
\q1
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the voice of your cataracts: all your billows and your waves have gone over me. 
\q1
\v 8 By day the Lord will command his mercy, and \f + \fr 41:8  \fl Heb. \ft and \fl Alex. \ft his song shall be, etc. \f* manifest \add it\add* by night: with me \add is\add* prayer to the God of my life. 
\q1
\v 9 I will say to God, You are my helper; why have you forgotten me? therefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses \add me\add*? 
\q1
\v 10 While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is your God? 
\q1
\v 11 Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; \add he is\add* the health of my countenance, and my God.

\d (43) A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. 
\q1
\v 2 For you, O God, are my strength: therefore have you cast me off? and why do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses \add me\add*? 
\q1
\v 3 Send forth your light and your truth: they have led me, and brought me to your holy mountain, and to your tabernacles. 
\q1
\v 4 And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who gladdens my youth: I will give thanks to you on the harp, O God, my God.

\q1
\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which you wrought in their days, in the days of old. 
\q1
\v 2 Your hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and you did plant them: you did afflict the nations, and cast them out. 
\q1
\v 3 For they inherited not the land by their \add own\add* sword, and their \add own\add* arm did not deliver them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you were well pleased in them. 
\q1
\v 4 You are indeed my King and my God, who command deliverances for Jacob. 
\q1
\v 5 In you will we push down our enemies, and in your name will we bring to nothing them that rise up against us. 
\q1
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. 
\q1
\v 7 For you have saved us from them that afflicted us, and have put to shame them that hated us. 
\q1
\v 8 In God \f + \fr 43:8  \fl Gr. \ft will be praised etc. See Ps. 106. \f* will we make our boast all the day, and to your name will we give thanks for ever. Pause. 
\q1
\v 9 But now you have cast off, and put us to shame; and you will not go forth with our hosts. 
\q1
\v 10 You have turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. 
\q1
\v 11 You made us as sheep for meat; and you scattered us among the nations. 
\q1
\v 12 You have sold your people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange. 
\q1
\v 13 You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision them that are round about us. 
\q1
\v 14 You have made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. 
\q1
\v 15 All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, 
\q1
\v 16 because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger. 
\q1
\v 17 All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten you, neither have we dealt unrighteously in your covenant. 
\q1
\v 18 And our heart has not gone back; but you have turned aside our paths from your way. 
\q1
\v 19 For you have laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. 
\q1
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out? 
\q1
\v 21 for he knows the secrets of the heart. 
\q1
\v 22  \x + \xo 43:22  \xt Rom 8:36 \x* For, for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter.

\v 23 Awake, therefore sleep you, O Lord? arise, and do not cast \add us\add* off for ever. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore turn you your face away, \add and\add* forget our poverty and our affliction? 
\q1
\v 25 For our soul has been brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth.

\q1
\v 10 Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear; forget also your people, and your father's house.

\v 15 O Lord, you shall open my lips; and my mouth shall declare your praise. 
\q1
\v 16 For if you desired sacrifice, I would have given \add it\add*: you will not take pleasure in whole burnt offerings. 
\q1
\v 17 Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.

\v 18 Do good, O Lord, to Sion in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built.

\v 2 your tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor you have wrought deceit.

\v 7 Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity. 
\q1
\v 8 But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore.

\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that does good.

\v 1 Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me by your might. 
\q1
\v 2 O God, hear my prayer; listen to the words of my mouth.

\v 4 For behold! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul.

\v 5 He shall return evil to my enemies; utterly destroy them in your truth.

\v 3 because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me. 
\q1
\v 4 My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. 
\q1
\v 5 Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. 
\q1
\v 6 And I said, O that I had wings as \add those\add* of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest. 
\q1

\v 15 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them. 
\q1
\v 16 I cried to God, and the Lord listened to me.

\v 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known \add my wants\add*: and he shall hear my voice.

\v 2 Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day from the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me.

\v 1 How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!

\v 5 They are not in the troubles of \add other\add* men; and they shall not be scourged with \add other\add* men.

\v 1 I cried to the Lord with my voice, yes, my voice \add was addressed\add* to God; and he gave heed to me. 
\q1
\v 2 In the day of my affliction I earnestly sought the Lord; \add even\add* with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted. 
\q1
\v 3 I remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted. Pause. 
\q1
\v 4 All my enemies set a watch \add against me\add*: I was troubled, and spoke not. 
\q1
\v 5 I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient years. 
\q1
\v 6 And I meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, \add saying\add*, 
\q1
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more? 
\q1
\v 8 Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever? 
\q1
\v 9 Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause. 
\q1
\v 10 And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most High. 
\q1
\v 11 I remembered the works of the Lord; for I will remember your wonders from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 12 And I will meditate on all your works, and will consider your doings. 
\q1
\v 13 O God, your way is in the sanctuary; who is a great God as our God? 
\q1
\v 14 You are the God that do wonders; you have made known your power among the nations. 
\q1
\v 15 You have with your arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Pause. 
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you, and feared; and the depths were troubled. 
\q1
\v 17  \add There was\add* an abundant sound of waters: the clouds uttered a voice; for your arrows went abroad. 
\q1
\v 18 The voice of your thunder was abroad, and around your lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked. 
\q1
\v 19 Your way is in the sea, and your paths in many waters, and your footsteps can’t be known. 
\q1
\v 20 You did guide your people as sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
\c 77  
\d (78) \add A Psalm\add* of \f + \fr 77:0  \fl Gr. \ft understanding.\f* instruction for Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. 
\q1
\v 2  \x + \xo 77:2  \xt Matt 13:35 \x* I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings \add which have been\add* from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 3 All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. 
\q1
\v 4 They were not hid from their children to a second generations; \add the fathers\add* declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. 
\q1
\v 5 And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: 
\q1
\v 6 that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. 
\q1
\v 7 That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. 
\q1
\v 8 That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not \f + \fr 77:8  \fl Or, \ft faithfully secured.\f* steadfast with God. 
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting \add with\add* the bow, turned \add back\add* in the day of battle. 
\q1
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. 
\q1
\v 11 And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he \add had\add* showed them; 
\q1
\v 12 the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. 
\q1
\v 13 He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as \add in\add* a bottle. 
\q1
\v 14 And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\q1
\v 15 he clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep. 
\q1
\v 16 And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers. 
\q1
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 18 And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for \add the desire of\add* their souls. 
\q1
\v 19 They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? 
\q1
\v 20 Forasmuch as he struck the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? 
\q1
\v 21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. 
\q1
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. 
\q1
\v 23 Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
\q1
\v 24 and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. 
\q1
\v 25 Man ate angels' bread; \x + \xo 77:25  \xt Matt 6:31 \x* he sent them provision to the full. 
\q1
\v 26 He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the southwest wind. 
\q1
\v 27 And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. 
\q1
\v 28 And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. 
\q1
\v 29 So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. 
\q1
\v 30 They were not disappointed of their desire: \add but\add* when their food was yet in their mouth, 
\q1
\v 31 then the indignation of God rose up against them, and killed the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. 
\q1
\v 32 In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. 
\q1
\v 33 And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety. 
\q1
\v 34 When he killed them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. 
\q1
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. 
\q1
\v 36 Yet they loved him \add only\add* with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 
\q1
\v 37 For their heart \add was\add* not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
\q1
\v 38 But he is compassionate, and will \f + \fr 77:38  \fl Gr. \ft be propitious, \fl or, \ft merciful to. \f* forgive their sins, and will not destroy \add them\add*: yes, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. 
\q1
\v 39 And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. 
\q1
\v 40 How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, \add and\add* anger him in a dry land! 
\q1
\v 41 Yes, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. 
\q1
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: 
\q1
\v 44 and had changed their rivers into blood; and their \f + \fr 77:44  \fl Gr. \ft rains, \fl or, \ft showers. \f* streams, that they should not drink. 
\q1
\v 45 He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. 
\q1
\v 46 And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labors to the locust. 
\q1
\v 47 He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. 
\q1
\v 48 And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. 
\q1
\v 49 He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. 
\q1
\v 50 He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; 
\q1
\v 51 and struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt; the first fruits of their labors in the tents of Cham. 
\q1
\v 52 And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 53 And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. 
\q1
\v 54 And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. 
\q1
\v 55 And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. 
\q1
\v 57 And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. 
\q1
\v 58 And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\q1
\v 59 God heard and \f + \fr 77:59  \fl Lit. \ft overlooked them. See Acts 17:30. \f* lightly regarded \add them\add*, and greatly despised Israel. 
\q1
\v 60 And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he lived among men. 
\q1
\v 61 And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. 
\q1
\v 62 And he \f + \fr 77:62  \fl Gr. \ft shut up. \f* gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. 
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. 
\q1
\v 65 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \add and\add* as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. 
\q1
\v 66 And he struck his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. 
\q1
\v 67 And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 
\q1
\v 68 but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. 
\q1
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary as \add the place\add* of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth. 
\q1
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. 
\q1
\v 71 He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 72 So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. 
\c 78  
\d (79) A Psalm for Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 O God, the heathen are come into your inheritance; they have polluted your holy temple; they have made Jerusalem a storehouse of fruits. 
\q1
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants \add to be\add* food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your holy ones for the wild beasts of the earth. 
\q1
\v 3 They have shed their blood as water, round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them \add that are\add* round about us. 
\q1
\v 5 How long, O Lord? will you be angry for ever? shall your jealousy burn like fire? 
\q1
\v 6 Pour out your wrath upon the heathen that have not known you, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon your name. 
\q1
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid his place waste. 
\q1
\v 8 Remember not our old transgressions; let your tender mercies speedily prevent us; for we are greatly impoverished. 
\q1
\v 9 Help us, O God our Saviour; for the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us; and be merciful to our sins, for your name's sake. 
\q1
\v 10 Lest haply they should say among the heathen, Where is their God? and let the avenging of your servant's blood that has been shed be known among the heathen before our eyes. 
\q1
\v 11 Let the groaning of the prisoners come in before you; according to the greatness of your arm preserve the \f + \fr 78:11  \fl i.e. \ft men appointed to die. \f* sons of the slain ones. 
\q1
\v 12 Repay to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached you, O Lord. 
\q1
\v 13 For we are your people and the sheep of your pasture; we will give you thanks for ever; we will declare your praise throughout all generations.

\q1
\v 1 Attend, O Shepherd of Israel, who guide Joseph like a flock; you who sit upon the cherubs, manifest yourself; 
\q1
\v 2 before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse, stir up your power, and come to deliver us. 
\q1
\v 3 Turn us, O God, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be delivered. 
\q1
\v 4 O Lord God of hosts, how long are you angry with the prayer of your servant? 
\q1
\v 5 You will feed us with bread of tears; and will cause us to drink tears by measure. 
\q1
\v 6 You have made us a strife to our neighbors; and our enemies have mocked at us. 
\q1
\v 7 Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved. Pause. 
\q1
\v 8 You have transplanted a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
\q1
\v 9 You made a way before it, and did cause its roots to strike, and the land was filled \add with it\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 Its shadow covered the mountains, and its shoots \add equalled\add* the \f + \fr 79:10  \fl Gr. \ft Cedars of God, see Gen. 30:8; Jonah 3:3; Acts 7:20. \f* goodly cedars. 
\q1
\v 11 It sent forth its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river. 
\q1
\v 12 Therefore have you broken down its hedge, while all that pass by the way pluck it? 
\q1
\v 13 The boar out of the wood has laid it waste, and the wild beast has devoured it. 
\q1
\v 14 O God of hosts, turn, we pray you: look on \add us\add* from heaven, and behold and visit this vine; 
\q1
\v 15 and restore that which your right hand has planted: and look on the son of man whom you did strengthen for yourself.

\v 16  \add It is\add* burnt with fire and dug up: they shall perish at the rebuke of your \f + \fr 79:16  \fl Gr. \ft See Ps. 20:9. \f* presence. 
\q1
\v 17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, and upon the son of man whom you did strengthen for yourself. 
\q1
\v 18 So will we not depart from you: you shall quicken us, and we will call upon your name.

\v 1 Rejoice you⌃ in God our helper; shout aloud to the God of Jacob.

\v 5 He made \f + \fr 80:5  \fl Gr. \ft him, \fl sc. \ft Israel. \f* it \add to be\add* a testimony in Joseph, when he came forth out of the land of Egypt: he heard a language which he understood not. 
\q1
\v 6 He removed his back from burdens: his hands slaved in making the baskets. 
\q1
\v 7 You did call upon me in trouble, and I delivered you; I heard you in the secret place of the storm: I proved you at the water of \f + \fr 80:7  \fl Lit. \ft contradiction. \f* Strife. Pause. 
\q1
\v 8 Hear, my people, and I will speak to you, O Israel; and I will testify to you: if you will listen to me; 
\q1
\v 9 there shall be no new god in you; neither shall you worship a strange god. 
\q1
\v 10 For I am the Lord your God, that brought you out of the land of Egypt: open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
\q1
\v 11 But my people listened not to my voice; and Israel gave no heed to me. 
\q1
\v 12 So I let them go after the ways of their own hearts: they will go on in their own ways. 
\q1
\v 13 If my people had listened to me, if Israel had walked in my ways, 
\q1
\v 14 I should have put down their enemies very quickly, and should have laid my hand upon those that afflicted them.

\d (82) A Psalm for Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 God stands in the assembly of gods; and in the midst \add of them\add* will judge gods.

\v 2 How long will you⌃ judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of sinners? Pause.

\v 3 Judge the orphan and poor: \f + \fr 81:3  \fl Gr. \ft justify. \f* do justice to the low and needy. 
\q1
\v 4 Rescue the needy, and deliver the poor out of the hand of the sinner. 
\q1
\v 5 They know not, nor understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken. 
\q1
\v 6 I have said, You⌃ are gods; and all \add of you\add* children of the Most High.

\v 7 But you⌃ die as men, and fall as one of the princes.

\d (83) A Song of a Psalm for Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 O God, who shall be compared to you? be not silent, neither be still, O God. 
\q1
\v 2 For behold, your enemies have made a noise; and they that hate you have lifted up the head. 
\q1
\v 3 Against your people they have craftily imagined a device, and have taken counsel against your saints. 
\q1
\v 4 They have said, Come, and let us utterly destroy them out of the nation; and let the name of Israel be remembered no more at all. 
\q1
\v 5 For they have taken counsel together with one consent: they have made a confederacy against you; 
\q1
\v 6 even the tents of the Idumeans, and the Ismaelites; Moab, and the Agarenes; 
\q1
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalec; the Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre. 
\q1
\v 8 Yes, Assur too is come with them: they have become a help to the children of Lot. Pause. 
\q1
\v 9 Do you to them as to Madiam, and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the brook of Kison. 
\q1
\v 10 They were utterly destroyed at Aendor: they became as dung for the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; \add even\add* all their princes:

\v 12 who said, let us take to ourselves the \f + \fr 82:12  \fl Alex. \ft sanctuary. \f* altar of God as an inheritance. 
\q1
\v 13 O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face of the wind.

\v 14 As fire which shall burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains; 
\q1
\v 15 so shall you persecute them with your tempest, and trouble them in your anger. 
\q1
\v 16 Fill their faces with dishonor; so shall they seek your name, O Lord. 
\q1
\v 17 Let them be ashamed and troubled for evermore; yes, let them be confounded and destroyed.

\d (84) For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core, concerning the wine presses.

\v 1 How amiable are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! 
\q1
\v 2 My soul longs, and faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh have exulted in the living god. 
\q1
\v 3 Yes, the sparrow has found himself a home, and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, \add even\add* your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. 
\q1
\v 4 Blessed are they that dwell in your house: they will praise you evermore. Pause. 
\q1
\v 5 Blessed is the man whose help is of you, O Lord; in his heart he has purposed to go up

\v 6 the valley of weeping, to the place which he has appointed, for \add there\add* the law-giver will grant blessings. 
\q1
\v 7 They shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.

\v 8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: listen, O God of Jacob. Pause. 
\q1
\v 9 Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of your anointed. 
\q1
\v 10 For one day in your courts is better than thousands. I would rather be an abject in the house of God, than dwell in the tents of sinners. 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord loves mercy and truth: God will give grace and glory: the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocence.

\d (85) For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, you have taken pleasure in your land: you have turned back the captivity of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 2 You have forgiven your people their transgressions; you have covered all their sins. Pause. 
\q1
\v 3 You have caused all your wrath to cease: you have turned from your fierce anger. 
\q1
\v 4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn your anger away from us. 
\q1
\v 5 Wouldest you be angry with us for ever? or will you continue your wrath from generation to generation? 
\q1
\v 6 O God, you will turn and quicken us; and your people shall rejoice in you. 
\q1
\v 7 Show us your mercy, O Lord, and grant us your salvation. 
\q1
\v 8 I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart toward him. 
\q1
\v 9 Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
\q1
\v 10 Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed \add each other\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. 
\q1
\v 12 For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit. 
\q1
\v 13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.

\d (86) A Prayer of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, incline your ear, and listen to me; for I am poor and needy.

\v 2 Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save your servant, O God, who hopes in you. 
\q1
\v 3 Pity me, O Lord: for to you will I cry all the day. 
\q1
\v 4 Rejoice the soul of your servant: for to you, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.

\v 5 For you, O Lord, are kind, and gentle; and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon you. 
\q1
\v 6 Give ear to my prayer, o Lord; and attend to the voice of my supplication. 
\q1
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I cried to you: for you did hear me. 
\q1
\v 8 There is none like to you, O Lord, among the gods; and there are no \add works\add* like to your works. 
\q1
\v 9 All nations whom you have made shall come, and shall worship before you, O Lord; and shall glorify your name. 
\q1
\v 10 For you are great, and do wonders: you are the only \add and\add* the great God. 
\q1
\v 11 Guide me, O Lord, in your way, and I will walk in your truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear your name. 
\q1
\v 12 I will give you thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify your name for ever. 
\q1
\v 13 For your mercy is great toward me; and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
\q1
\v 14 O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent \add men\add* have sought my life; and have not set you before them. 
\q1
\v 15 But you, O Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, longsuffering, and abundant in mercy and true. 
\q1

\v 1 His foundations are in the holy mountains. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord loves the gates of Sion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 3 Glorious things have been spoken of you, O city of God. Pause. 
\q1
\v 4 I will make mention of Raab and Babylon to them that know me: behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these were born there. 
\q1
\v 5 A man shall say, Sion \add is my\add* mother; and \add such\add* a man was born in her; and the Highest himself has founded her.

\d (101) A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1  I will sing to you, O Lord, of mercy and judgment; I will sing a psalm, 
\q1
\v 2 and I will be wise in a blameless way. When will you come to me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house. 
\q1
\v 3 I have not set before my eyes any unlawful thing; I have hated transgressors. 
\q1
\v 4 A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me. 
\q1
\v 5 Him that privily speaks against his neighbor, him have I driven from \add me\add*: he that is proud in look and insatiable in heart, —with him I have not eaten. 
\q1
\v 6 My eyes \add shall be\add* upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same ministered to me. 
\q1
\v 7 The proud doer lived not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my sight. 
\q1
\v 8 Early did I kill all the sinners of the land, that I might destroy out of the city of the Lord all that work iniquity.

\q1
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come to you. 
\q1
\v 2 Turn not away your face from me: in the day \add when\add* I am afflicted, incline your ear to me: in the day \add when\add* I shall call upon you, speedily hear me. 
\q1
\v 3 For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been parched like a stick. 
\q1
\v 4 I am blighted like grass, and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread. 
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone has cleaved to my flesh. 
\q1
\v 6 I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; 
\q1
\v 7 I have become like an owl in a ruined house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a roof. 
\q1
\v 8 All the day long my enemies have reproached me; and they that praised me have sworn against me. 
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping; 
\q1
\v 10 because of your anger and your wrath: for you have lifted me up, and dashed me down. 
\q1
\v 11 My days have declined like a shadow; and I am withered like grass. 
\q1
\v 12 But you, Lord, endure for ever, and your memorial to generation and generation. 
\q1
\v 13 You shall arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for \add it is\add* time to have mercy upon her, for the set time is come. 
\q1
\v 14 For your servants have taken pleasure in her stones, and they shall pity her dust.

\q1
\v 19 For he has looked out from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord looked upon the earth from heaven;

\v 21 to proclaim the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
\q1
\v 22 when the people are gathered together, and the kings, to serve the Lord.

\q1
\v 6 The Lord executes mercy and judgment for all that are injured.

\v 8 The Lord is compassionate and pitiful, longsuffering, and full of mercy. 
\q1
\v 9 He will not be always angry; neither will he be wrathful for ever. 
\q1
\v 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according to our iniquities.

\v 15  \add As for\add* man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he flourish. 
\q1
\v 16 For the wind passes over it, and it shall not be; and it shall know its place no more.

\q1
\v 23 So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn \add him\add* away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them.

\v 5 Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; and your glory above all the earth.

\v 8 Galaad is mine; and Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of my head; Judas is my king;

\q1
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. O God, pass not over my praise in silence;

\v 2 for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty \add man\add* have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue.

\v 11 Let \add his\add* creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his labors.

\v 12 Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children.

\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 15 Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth.

\v 16 Because he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and \add that\add* to kill him that was pricked in the heart. 
\q1
\v 17 He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.

\v 18 Yes, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. 
\q1
\v 19 Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually.

\v 27 And let them know that this is your hand; and \add that\add* you, Lord, have wrought it.

\v 28 Let them curse, but you shall bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let your servant rejoice. 
\q1
\v 29 Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle. 
\q1
\v 30 I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him.

\v 105 Your law is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.
