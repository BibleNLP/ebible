In the bigynnyng God made of nouyt heuene and erthe.
Forsothe the erthe was idel and voide, and derknessis weren on the face of depthe; and the Spiryt of the Lord was borun on the watris.
And God seide, Liyt be maad, and liyt was maad.
And God seiy the liyt, that it was good, and he departide the liyt fro derknessis; and he clepide the liyt,
dai, and the derknessis, nyyt. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, o daie.
And God seide, The firmament be maad in the myddis of watris, and departe watris fro watris.
And God made the firmament, and departide the watris that weren vndur the firmament fro these watris that weren on the firmament; and it was don so.
And God clepide the firmament, heuene. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the secounde dai.
Forsothe God seide, The watris, that ben vndur heuene, be gaderid in to o place, and a drie place appere; and it was doon so.
And God clepide the drie place, erthe; and he clepide the gadryngis togidere of watris, the sees. And God seiy that it was good;
and seide, The erthe brynge forth greene eerbe and makynge seed, and appil tre makynge fruyt bi his kynde, whos seed be in it silf on erthe; and it was doon so.
And the erthe brouyte forth greene erbe and makynge seed bi his kynde, and a tre makynge fruyt, and ech hauynge seed by his kynde. And God seiy that it was good.
And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the thridde dai.
Forsothe God seide, Liytis be maad in the firmament of heuene, and departe tho the dai and niyt; and be tho in to signes, and tymes, and daies, and yeeris;
and shyne tho in the firmament of heuene, and liytne tho the erthe; and it was doon so.
And God made twei grete liytis, the gretter liyt that it schulde be bifore to the dai, and the lesse liyt that it schulde be bifore to the niyt;
and God made sterris; and settide tho in the firmament of heuene, that tho schulden schyne on erthe,
and that tho schulden be bifore to the dai and nyyt, and schulden departe liyt and derknesse. And God seiy that it was good.
And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fourthe dai.
Also God seide, The watris brynge forth a `crepynge beeste of lyuynge soule, and a brid fleynge aboue erthe vndur the firmament of heuene.
And God made of nouyt grete whallis, and ech lyuynge soule and mouable, whiche the watris han brouyt forth in to her kyndis; and God made of nouyt ech volatile bi his kynde. And God seiy that it was good;
and blesside hem, and seide, Wexe ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the watris of the see, and briddis be multiplied on erthe.
And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fyuethe dai.
And God seide, The erthe brynge forth a lyuynge soul in his kynde, werk beestis, and `crepynge beestis, and vnresonable beestis of erthe, bi her kyndis; and it was don so.
And God made vnresonable beestis of erthe bi her kyndes, and werk beestis, `and ech crepynge beeste of erthe in his kynde. And God seiy that it was good; and seide,
Make we man to oure ymage and liknesse, and be he souereyn to the fischis of the see, and to the volatilis of heuene, and to vnresonable beestis of erthe, and to ech creature, and to ech `crepynge beest, which is moued in erthe.
And God made of nouyt a man to his ymage and liknesse; God made of nouyt a man, to the ymage of God; God made of nouyt hem, male and female.
And God blesside hem, and seide, Encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the erthe, and make ye it suget, and be ye lordis to fischis of the see, and to volatilis of heuene, and to alle lyuynge beestis that ben moued on erthe.
And God seide, Lo! Y haue youe to you ech eerbe berynge seed on erthe, and alle trees that han in hem silf the seed of her kynde, that tho be in to mete to you;
and to alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and to ech brid of heuene, and to alle thingis that ben moued in erthe, and in whiche is a lyuynge soule, that tho haue to ete; and it was doon so.
And God seiy alle thingis whiche he made, and tho weren ful goode. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the sixte day.
Therfor heuenes and erthe ben maad perfit, and al the ournement of tho.
And God fillide in the seuenthe dai his werk which he made; and he restide in the seuenthe dai fro al his werk which he hadde maad;
and he blesside the seuenthe dai, and halewide it; for in that dai God ceesside of al his werk which he made of nouyt, that he schulde make.
These ben the generaciouns of heuene and of erthe, in the day wherynne the Lord God made heuene and erthe,
and ech litil tre of erthe bifore that it sprong out in erthe; and he made ech erbe of the feeld bifore that it buriownede. For the Lord God had not reyned on erthe, and no man was that wrouyte erthe;
but a welle stiede out of the erthe, and moistide al the hiyere part of erthe.
Therfor the Lord God formede man of the sliym of erthe, and brethide in to his face the brething of lijf; and man was maad in to a lyuynge soule.
Forsothe the Lord God plauntide at the bigynnyng paradis of likyng, wherynne he settide man whom he hadde formed.
And the Lord God brouyte forth of the erthe ech tre fair in siyt, and swete to ete; also he brouyte forth the tre of lijf in the middis of paradis, and the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel.
And a ryuer yede out fro the place of likyng to moyste paradis, which ryuer is departid fro thennus in to foure heedis.
The name of the o ryuer is Fyson, thilke it is that cumpassith al the lond of Euilath, where gold cometh forth,
and the gold of that lond is the beste, and there is foundun delium, that is, a tree of spicerie, and the stoon onychyn;
and the name to the secounde ryuer is Gyon, thilke it is that cumpassith al the loond of Ethiopie;
forsothe the name of the thridde ryuer is Tigris, thilke goith ayens Assiriens; sotheli the fourthe ryuer is thilke Eufrates.
Therfor the Lord God took man, and settide hym in paradis of likyng, that he schulde worche and kepe it.
And God comaundide to hym and seide, Ete thou of ech tre of paradis;
forsothe ete thou not of the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel; for in what euere dai thou schalt ete therof, thou schalt die bi deeth.
And the Lord God seide, It is not good that a man be aloone, make we to hym an help lijk to hym silf.
Therfor whanne alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and alle the volatils of heuene weren formed of erthe, the Lord God brouyte tho to Adam, that he schulde se what he schulde clepe tho; for al thing that Adam clepide of lyuynge soule, thilke is the name therof.
And Adam clepide bi her names alle lyuynge thingis, and alle volatils, and alle vnresonable beestis of erthe. Forsothe to Adam was not foundun an helpere lijk hym.
Therfore the Lord God sente sleep in to Adam, and whanne he slepte, God took oon of hise ribbis, and fillide fleisch for it.
And the Lord God bildide the rib which he hadde take fro Adam in to a womman, and brouyte hir to Adam.
And Adam seide, This is now a boon of my boonys, and fleisch of my fleisch; this schal be clepid virago, `for she is takun of man.
Wherfor a man schal forsake fadir and modir, and schal cleue to his wijf, and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
Forsothe euer eithir was nakid, that is, Adam and his wijf, and thei weren not aschamed.
But and the serpent was feller than alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, whiche the Lord God hadde maad. Which serpent seide to the womman, Why comaundide God to you, that ye schulden not ete of ech tre of paradis?
To whom the womman answerde, We eten of the fruyt of trees that ben in paradis;
sothely God commaundide to vs, that we schulden not eate of the fruyt of the tre, which is in the myddis of paradijs, and that we schulden not touche it, lest perauenture we dien.
Forsothe the serpent seide to the womman, ye schulen not die bi deeth;
for whi God woot that in what euere dai ye schulen ete therof, youre iyen schulen be opened, and ye schulen be as Goddis, knowynge good and yuel.
Therfore the womman seiy that the tre was good, and swete to ete, and fair to the iyen, and delitable in bi holdyng; and sche took of the fruyt therof, and eet, and yaf to hir hosebande, and he eet.
And the iyen of bothe weren openid; and whanne thei knowen that thei weren nakid, thei sewden the leeues of a fige tre, and maden brechis to hem silf.
And whanne thei herden the vois of the Lord God goynge in paradijs at the wynd after myddai, Adam and his wijf hidden hem fro the face of the Lord God in the middis of the tre of paradijs.
And the Lord God clepide Adam, and seide to hym, Where art thou?
And Adam seide, Y herde thi vois in paradijs, and Y drede, for Y was nakid, and Y hidde me.
To whom the Lord seide, Who forsothe schewide to thee that thou were nakid, no but for thou hast ete of the tre of which Y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete?
And Adam seide, The womman which thou yauest felowe to me, yaf me of the tre, and Y eet.
And the Lord seide to the womman, Whi didist thou this thing? Which answerde, The serpent disseyued me, and Y eet.
And the Lord God seide to the serpent, For thou didist this, thou schalt be cursid among alle lyuynge thingis and vnresonable beestis of erthe; thou schalt go on thi brest, and thou schalt ete erthe in alle daies of thi liif;
Y schal sette enemytees bitwixe thee and the womman, and bitwixe thi seed and hir seed; sche schal breke thin heed, and thou schalt sette aspies to hir heele.
Also God seide to the womman, Y schal multiplie thi wretchidnessis and thi conseyuyngis; in sorewe thou schalt bere thi children; and thou schalt be vndur power of the hosebonde, and he schal be lord of thee.
Sothely God seyde to Adam, For thou herdist the voys of thi wijf, and hast ete of the tree, of which Y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete, the erthe schal be cursid in thi werk; in traueylis thou schalt ete therof in alle daies of thi lijf;
it schal brynge forth thornes and breris to thee, and thou schalt ete eerbis of the erthe;
in swoot of thi cheer thou schalt ete thi breed, til thou turne ayen in to the erthe of which thou art takun; for thou art dust, and thou schalt turne ayen in to dust.
And Adam clepide the name of his wijf Eue, for sche was the moder of alle men lyuynge.
And the Lord God made cootis of skynnys to Adam and Eue his wijf, and clothide hem; and seide, Lo!
Adam is maad as oon of vs, and knowith good and yuel; now therfore se ye, lest perauenture he putte his hond, and take of the tre of lijf, and ete, and lyue with outen ende.
And the Lord God sente hym out of paradijs of likyng, that he schulde worche the erthe, of which he was takun.
And God castide out Adam, and settide bifore paradis of lykyng cherubyn, and a swerd of flawme and turnynge aboute to kepe the weie of the tre of lijf.
Forsothe Adam knewe Eue his wijf, which conseyuede, and childide Cayn, and seide, Y haue gete a man bi God.
And efte sche childide his brother Abel. Forsothe Abel was a kepere of scheep, and Cayn was an erthe tilyere.
Sotheli it was don after many daies, that Cayn offride yiftis to the Lord of the fruytis of erthe;
and Abel offride of the first gendrid of his floc, and of the fatnesse of tho. And the Lord bihelde to Abel and to the yiftis of hym;
sotheli he bihelde not to Cayn and to hise yiftis. And Cayn was wrooth greetli, and his cheer felde doun.
And the Lord seide to hym, Whi art thou wrooth, and whi felde doun thi face?
Whether not if thou schalt do wel, thou schalt resseyue; but if thou doist yuele, thi synne schal be present anoon in the yatis? but the desir therof schal be vndur thee, and thou schalt be lord therof.
And Cayn seide to Abel his brother, Go we out. And whanne thei weren in the feeld, Cayn roos ayens his brother Abel, and killide him.
And the Lord seide to Cayn, Where is Abel thi brother? Which answerde, Y woot not; whether Y am the kepere of my brothir?
And God seide to Cayn, What hast thou do? the vois of the blood of thi brother crieth to me fro erthe.
Now therfor thou schalt be cursid on erthe, that openyde his mouth, and resseyuede of thin hond the blood of thi brothir.
Whanne thou schalt worche the erthe, it schal not yyue his fruytis to thee; thou schalt be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute on erthe in alle the daies of thi lijf.
And Cayn seide to the Lord, My wickidnesse is more than that Y disserue foryyuenesse; lo!
to dai thou castist me out fro the face of the erthe; and Y schal be hid fro thi face, and Y schal be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute in erthe; therfore ech man that schal fynde me schal slee me.
And the Lord seide to hym, It schal not be don so, but ech man that schal slee Cayn shal be punyschid seuenfold. And the Lord settide a signe in Cayn, that ech man that schulde fynde hym schulde not slee hym.
And Cayn yede out fro the face of the Lord, and dwellide fleynge aboute in erthe, at the eest coost of Eden.
Forsothe Cayn knewe his wiif, which conseyuede, and childide Enoth; and Cayn bildide a citee, and clepide the name therof of the name of hise sone Enoth.
Forsothe Enoth gendride Irad, and Irad gendride Manyael, and Manyael gendride Matusael, and Matusael gendride Lameth;
that took twei wyues, the name to o wijf was Ada, and the name to the tother was Sella.
And Ada gendride Jabel, that was the fadir of dwellers in tentis and of shepherdis;
and the name of his brother was Tubal, he was the fadir of syngeris in harpe and orgun.
And Sella gendride Tubalcayn, that was an hamerbetere, and smyyt on alle werkis of bras and of yrun; forsothe the sistir of Tubalcayn was Neoma.
And Lameth seide to his wyues Ada and Sella, Ye wyues of Lameth, here my vois, and herkne my word; for Y haue slayn a man bi my wounde, and a yong wexynge man bi my `violent betyng;
veniaunce schal be youun seuenfold of Cayn, forsothe of Lameth seuentisithis seuensithis.
Also yit Adam knewe his wijf, and sche childide a sone, and clepide his name Seth, and seide, God hath put to me another seed for Abel, whom Cayn killide.
But also a sone was borun to Seth, which sone he clepide Enos; this Enos bigan to clepe inwardli the name of the Lord.
This is the book of generacioun of Adam, in the dai wher ynne God made man of nouyt. God made man to the ymage and licnesse of God;
God formede hem male and female, and blesside hem, and clepide the name of hem Adam, in the day in which thei weren formed.
Forsothe Adam lyuede an hundrid yeer and thretti, and gendride a sone to his ymage and liknesse, and clepide his name Seth.
And the daies of Adam after that he gendride Seth weren maad eiyte hundrid yeer, and he gendride sones and douytris.
And al the tyme in which Adam lyuede was maad nyne hundrid yeer and thretti, and he was deed.
Also Seth lyuede an hundrid and fyue yeer, and gendride Enos.
And Seth lyuede aftir that he gendride Enos eiyte hundrid and seuen yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Seth weren maad nyne hundrid and twelue yeer, and he was deed.
Forsothe Enos lyuede nynti yeer, and gendride Caynan;
aftir whos birthe Enos lyuede eiyte hundrid and fiftene yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Enos weren maad nyne hundrid and fyue yeer, and he was deed.
Also Caynan lyuyde seuenti yeer, and gendride Malalehel.
And Caynan lyuede after that he gendride Malalehel eiyte hundrid and fourti yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the dayes of Caynan weren maad nyn hundrid and ten yeer, and he was deed.
Forsothe Malalehel lyuede sixti yeer and fyue, and gendride Jared.
And Malalehel lyuede aftir that he gendride Jared eiyte hundrid and thretti yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Malalehel weren maad eiyte hundrid nynti and fyue yeer, and he was deed.
And Jared lyuede an hundrid and two and sixti yeer, and gendride Enoth.
And Jared lyuede aftir that he gendride Enoth eiyte hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the dayes of Jared weren maad nyn hundrid and twei and sexti yeer, and he was deed.
Forsothe Enoth lyuede fyue and sixti yeer, and gendride Matusalem.
And Enoth yede with God; and Enoth lyuede after that he gendride Matusalem thre hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Enoth weren maad thre hundride and fyue and sexti yeer.
And Enoth yeed with God, and apperide not afterward, for God took hym awei.
Also Matusalem lyuede an hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and seuene, and gendride Lameth.
And Matusalem lyuede after that he gendride Lameth seuene hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and twei, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Matusale weren maad nyn hundrid and nyn and sixti yeer, and he was deed.
Forsothe Lameth lyuede an hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and two, and gendride a sone;
and clepide his name Noe, and seide, This man schal comforte vs of the werkis and traueilis of oure hondis, in the loond which the Lord curside.
And Lameth lyuede after that he gendride Noe fyue hundrid `nynti and fyue yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And alle the daies of Lameth weren maad seuene hundrid `thre scoor and seuentene yeer, and he was deed.

Forsothe Noe whanne he was of fyue hundrid yeer gendride Sem, Cham, and Jafeth. And whanne men bigunnen to be multiplied on erthe, and hadden gendrid douytris,
the sones of God seiyen the douytris of men that thei weren faire, and token wyues to hem of alle whiche thei hadden chose.
And God seide, My spirit schal not dwelle in man with outen ende, for he is fleisch; and the daies of hym schulen be an hundrid and twenti yeer.
Sotheli giauntis weren on erthe in tho daies, forsothe aftir that the sones of God entriden to the douytris of men, and tho douytris gendriden; these weren myyti of the world and famouse men.
Sotheli God seiy that myche malice of men was in erthe, and that al the thouyt of herte was ententif to yuel in al tyme,
and repentide him that he hadde maad man in erthe; and God was war bifore ayens tyme to comyng, and was touchid with sorewe of herte with ynne;
and seide, Y schal do awei man, whom Y made of nouyt, fro the face of the erthe, fro man til to lyuynge thingis, fro crepynge beeste til to the briddis of heuene; for it repentith me that Y made hem.
Forsothe Noe foond grace bifore the Lord.
These ben the generaciouns of Noe. Noe was a iust man and perfit in hise generaciouns; Noe yede with God,
and gendride thre sones, Sem, Cam, and Jafeth.
Forsothe the erthe was corrupt bifore God, and was fillid with wickidnes.
And whanne God seiy, that the erthe was corrupt, for ech fleisch ether man hadde corrupt his weie on erthe,
he seide to Noe, The ende of al fleisch is comen bifore me; the erthe is fillid with wickidnesse of the face of hem, and Y schal distrye hem with the erthe.
Make thou to thee a schip of trees hewun and planed; thou schalt make dwellynge placis in the schip, and thou schalt anoynte it with pitche with ynne and with outforth.
And so thou schalt make it. The lengthe of the schip schal be of thre hundrid cubitis, the brede schal be of fifti cubitis, and the hiynesse therof schal be of thretti cubitis.
Thou schalt make a wyndow in the schip, and thou schalt ende the hiynesse therof in a cubite; sotheli thou schalt sette the dore of the schip in the side binethe; thou shalt make soleris and placis of thre chaumbris in the schip.
Lo! Y schal brynge `watris of diluuye ether greet flood on erthe, and Y schal sle ech fleisch in which is the spirit of lijf vndir heuene, and alle thingis that ben in erthe, schulen be wastid.
And Y schal sette my couenaunt of pees with thee; and thou schalt entre in to the schip, and thy sones, and thi wijf, and the wiues of thi sones schulen entre with thee.
And of alle lyuynge beestis of al fleisch thou schalt brynge in to the schip tweyne and tweyne, of male kynde and female, that thei lyue with thee;
of briddis bi her kynde, and of werk beestis in her kynde, and of ech crepynge beeste of erthe, by her kynde; tweyne and tweyne of alle schulen entre with thee, that thei moun lyue.
Therfore thou schalt take with thee of alle metis that moun be etun, and thou schalt bere to gidre at thee, and tho schulen be as well to thee as to the beestis in to mete.
Therfor Noe dide alle thingis whiche God comaundide to hym.
Also the Lord seide to Noe, Entre thou and al thin hous in to the schip, for Y seiy thee iust bifore me in this generacioun.
Of alle clene lyuynge beestis thou schalt take bi seuene and bi seuene, male and female; forsothe of vnclene lyuynge beestis thou schalt take bi tweyne and bi tweyne, male and female;
but also of volatils of heuene thou schalt take, bi seuene and bi seuene, male and female, that her seed be saued on the face of al erthe.
For yit and aftir seuene daies Y schal reyne on erthe fourti daies and fourti nyytis, and Y schal do awey al substaunce which Y made, fro the face of erthe.
Therfor Noe dide alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to hym.
And he was of sixe hundrid yeer, whanne the watris of the greet flood flowiden on erthe.
And Noe entride in to the schip, and hise sones, and hise wijf, and the wyues of his sones, entriden with him for the watris of the greet flood.
And of lyuynge beestis clene and vnclene, and of briddis of heuene, and of ech beeste which is moued on erthe,
bi tweyne and bi tweyne, male and female entriden to Noe in to the schip, as the Lord comaundide to Noe.
And whanne seuene daies hadden passid, the watris of the greet flood flowiden on erthe.
In the sixe hundrid yeer of the lijf of Noe, in the secunde moneth, in the seuententhe dai of the moneth, alle the wellis of the greet see weren brokun, and the wyndowis of heuene weren opened,
and reyn was maad on erthe fourti daies and fourti nyytis.
In the ende of that dai Noe entride, and Sem, Cham, and Japheth, hise sones, his wijf, and the wyues of hise sones, entriden with hem into the schip.
Thei entriden, and ech beeste bi his kynde, and alle werk beestis in her kynde, and ech beeste which is moued on erthe in his kynde, and ech volatil bi his kynde; alle briddis and alle volatils entriden to Noe in to the schip,
bi tweyne and bi tweyne of ech fleisch in whiche the spirit of lijf was.
And tho that entriden, entriden male and female of ech fleisch, as God comaundide to hym. And the Lord encloside hym fro with out-forth.
And the greet flood was maad fourti daies and fourti niytis on erthe, and the watris weren multiplied, and reiseden the schip on hiy fro erthe.
The watris flowiden greetli, and filliden alle thingis in the face of erthe. Forsothe the schip was borun on the watris.
And the watris hadden maistrie greetli on erthe, and alle hiye hillis vndur alle heuene weren hilid;
the watyr was hiyere bi fiftene cubitis ouer the hilis whiche it hilide.
And ech fleisch was wastid that was moued on erthe, of briddis, of lyuynge beestis, of vnresonable beestis, and of alle `reptilis that crepen on erthe.
Alle men, and alle thingis in whiche the brething of lijf was in erthe, weren deed.
And God dide awei al substaunce that was on erthe, fro man til to beeste, as wel a crepynge beeste as the briddis of heuene; and tho weren doon awei fro erthe. Forsothe Noe dwellide aloone, and thei that weren with hym in the schip.
And the watris of the greet flood ouereyeden the erthe an hundrid and fifti daies.
Forsothe the Lord hadde mynde of Noe, and of alle lyuynge beestis, and of alle werk beestis, that weren with hym in the schip; and brouyte a wynd on the erthe.
And watris weren decreessid, and the wellis of the see weren closid, and the wyndowis of heuene weren closid, and reynes of heuene weren ceessid.
And watrys turneden ayen fro erthe, and yeden ayen, and bigunnen to be decreessid aftir an hundrid and fifti daies.
And the schip restide in the seuenthe monthe, in the seuene and twentithe dai of the monthe, on the hillis of Armenye.
And sotheli the watrys yeden and decresiden til to the tenthe monethe, for in the tenthe monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, the coppis of hillis apperiden.
And whanne fourti daies weren passid, Noe openyde the wyndow of the schip which he hadde maad, and sente out a crowe,
which yede out, and turnede not ayen til the watris weren dried on erthe.
Also Noe sente out a culuer aftir hym, to se if the watris hadden ceessid thanne on the face of erthe;
and whanne the culuer foond not where hir foot schulde reste, sche turnede ayen to hym in to the schip, for the watris weren on al erthe; and Noe helde forth his hoond, and brouyte the culuer takun in to the schip.
Sotheli whanne othere seuene daies weren abedun aftirward, eft he leet out a culuer fro the schip;
and sche cam to hym at euentid, and bare in hir mouth a braunche of olyue tre with greene leeuys. Therfor Noe vndirstood that the watris hadden ceessid on erthe;
and neuerthelesse he abood seuene othere daies, and sente out a culuer, which turnede `no more ayen to hym.
Therfor in the sixe hundrid and o yeer of the lijf of Noe, in the firste monethe, in the firste day of the monethe, watris weren decreessid on erthe; and Noe openede the roof of the schip, and bihelde and seiy that the face of the erthe was dried.
In the secunde monethe, in the seuene and twentithe dai of the monethe, the erthe was maad drie.
Sotheli the Lord spak to Noe;
and seide, Go out of the schip, thou, and thi wijf, thi sones, and the wyues of thi sones with thee;
and lede out with thee alle lyuynge beestis that ben at thee of ech fleisch, as wel in volatilis as in vnresonable beestis, and alle `reptils that crepen on erthe; and entre ye on the erthe, encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied on erthe.
Therfor Noe yede out, and hise sones, and his wijf, and the wyues of hise sones with hym;
but also alle lyuynge beestis, and werk beestis, and `reptils that crepen on erthe, bi her kynde, yeden out of the schip.
Forsothe Noe bildide an auter to the Lord, and he took of alle clene beestis and briddis, and offride brent sacrifices on the auter.
And the Lord sauerede the odour of swetnesse, and seide to hym, Y schal no more curse the erthe for men, for the wit and thouyt of mannus herte ben redi in to yuel fro yong wexynge age; therfor Y schal no more smyte ech lyuynge soule as Y dide;
in alle the daies of erthe, seed and ripe corn, coold and heete, somer and wyntir, nyyt and dai, shulen not reste.
And God blisside Noe and hise sones, and seide to hem, Encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the erthe;
and youre drede and tremblyng be on alle vnresonable beestis of erthe, and on alle briddis of heuene, with alle thingis that ben moued in erthe; alle fischis of the see ben youun to youre hond.
And al thing which is moued and lyueth schal be to you in to mete; Y have youe to you alle thingis as greene wortis,
outakun that ye schulen not ete fleisch with blood,
for Y schal seke the blood of youre lyues of the hoond of alle vnresonable beestis and of the hoond of man, of the hoond of man and of hys brother Y schal seke the lijf of man.
Who euere schedith out mannus blood, his blood schal be sched; for man is maad to the ymage of God.
Forsothe encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and entre ye on erthe, and fille ye it, Also the Lord seide thes thingis to Noe,
and to his sones with him, Lo!
Y schal make my couenaunt with you, and with your seed after you,
and to ech lyuynge soule which is with you, as wel in briddis as in werk beestis and smale beestis of erthe, and to alle thingis that yeden out of the schip, and to alle vnresonable beestis of erthe.
Y schal make my couenaunt with you, and ech fleisch schal no more be slayn of the watris of the greet flood, nethir the greet flood distriynge al erthe schal be more.
And God seide, This is the signe of boond of pees, which Y yyue bitwixe me and you, and to ech lyuynge soule which is with you, in to euerlastynge generaciouns.
Y schal sette my bowe in the cloudis, and it schal be a signe of boond of pees bitwixe me and erthe;
and whanne Y schal hile heuene with cloudis, my bowe schal appere in the cloudis,
and Y schal haue mynde of my boond of pees which Y made with you, and with ech soule lyuynge, that nurschith fleisch; and the watris of the greet flood schulen no more be to do awey al fleish.
And my bowe schal be in the cloudis, and Y schal se it, and Y schal haue mynde of euerlastynge boond of pees, which is maad bitwixe God and man, and ech soul lyuynge of al fleisch which is on erthe.
And God seide to Noe, This schal be a signe of boond of pees, which Y made bitwixe me and ech fleisch on erthe.
Therfore thei that yeden out of the schip weren Noe, Sem, Cham, and Japheth; forsothe Cham, thilke is the fadir of Chanaan.
These thre weren the sones of Noe, and al the kynde of men was sowun of hem on al erthe.
And Noe, an erthe tiliere, bigan to tile the erthe, and he plauntide a viner,
and he drank wyn, and was drunkun; and he was nakid, and lay in his tabernacle.
And whanne Cham, the fadir of Chanaan, hadde seien this thing, that is, that the schameful membris of his fadir weren maad nakid, he telde to hise tweye britheren with out forth.
And sotheli Sem and Jafeth puttiden a mentil on her schuldris, and thei yeden bacward, and hileden the schameful membris of her fadir, and her faces weren turned awei, and thei sien not the priuy membris of her fadir.
And forsothe Noe wakide of the wyn, and whanne he hadde lerned what thingis his lesse sone hadde do to hym,
he seide, Cursid be the child Canaan, he schal be seruaunt of seruauntis to hise britheren.
And Noe seide, Blessid be the Lord God of Sem,
and Chanaan be the seruaunt to Sem; God alarge Jafeth, and dwelle in the tabernaclis of Sem, and Chanaan be seruaunt of hym.
Forsothe Noe lyuede aftir the greet flood thre hundrid and fifti yeer;
and alle the daies of hym weren fillid nyn hundrid and fifty yeer, and he was deed.
These ben the generaciouns of the sones of Noe, Sem, Cham, and Jafeth. And sones weren borun to hem aftir the greet flood.
The sones of Jafeth weren Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Jauan, and Tubal, and Mosoth, and Thiras.
Forsothe the sones of Gomer weren Asseneth, and Rifath, and Thogorma.
Forsothe the sones of Jauan weren Helisa, and Tharsis, Cethym, and Dodanym;
of these sones the ylis of hethen men weren departid in her cuntrees, ech bi his langage and meynees, in hise naciouns.
Sotheli the sones of Cham weren Thus, and Mesraym, and Futh, and Chanaan.
Forsothe the sones of Thus weren Saba, and Euila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The sones of Regma weren Saba, and Dadan.
Forsothe Thus gendride Nemroth; he bigan to be myyti in erthe,
and he was a strong huntere of men bifore the Lord; of hym a prouerbe yede out, as Nemroth, a strong huntere bifore the Lord.
Sotheli the bigynnyng of his rewme was Babiloyne, and Arach, and Archad, and Thalamye, in the lond of Sennaar.
Assur yede out of that lond, and bildide Nynyue, `and stretis of the citee,
and Chale, and Resen bitwixe Nynyue and Chale; this is a greet citee.
And sotheli Mesraym gendride Ludym, and Anamym, and Laabym, Neptuym, and Ferrusym, and Cesluym;
of which the Filisteis and Capturym camen forth.
Forsothe Chanaan gendride Sidon, his firste gendride sone, Ethei, and Jebusei,
and Amorrei, Gergesei,
Euei, and Arathei,
Ceney, and Aradie, Samarites, and Amathei; and puplis of Chananeis weren sowun abrood bi these men.
And the termes of Chanaan weren maad to men comynge fro Sidon to Gerara, til to Gasa, til thou entre in to Sodom and Gomore, and Adama, and Seboyne, til to Lesa.
These weren the sones of Cham, in her kynredis, and langagis, and generaciouns, and londis, and folkis.
Also of Sem weren borun the fadris of alle the sones of Heber, and Japhet was the more brother.
The sones of Sem weren Elam, and Assur, and Arfaxath, and Lud, and Aram.
The sones of Aram weren Vs, and Hul, and Gether, and Mes.
And sotheli Arfaxath gendride Sale, of whom Heber was borun.
And twei sones weren borun to Heber, the name to o sone was Faleg, for the lond was departid in hise daies; and the name of his brothir was Jectan.
And thilke Jectan gendride Elmodad, and Salech,
and Asamoth, Jare, and Adhuram, and Vsal,
and Deda, and Ebal, and Abymahel, Saba, and Ofir, and Euila, and Jobab;
alle these weren the sones of Jectan.
And the habitacioun of hem was maad fro Messa, as `me goith til to Sefar, an hil of the eest.
These ben the sones of Sem, bi kynredis, and langagis, and cuntrees, in her folkis.
These ben the meynees of Noe, bi her puplis and naciouns; folkis in erthe weren departid of these aftir the greet flood.
Forsothe the lond was of o langage, and of the same speche.
And whanne thei yeden forth fro the eest, thei fonden a feeld in the lond of Sennaar, and dwelliden ther ynne.
And oon seide to his neiybore, Come ye, and make we tiel stonys, and bake we tho with fier; and thei hadden tiel for stonus, and pitche for morter;
and seiden, Come ye, and make we to vs a citee and tour, whos hiynesse stretche `til to heuene; and make we solempne oure name bifor that we be departid in to alle londis.
Forsothe the Lord cam down to se the citee and tour, which the sones of Adam bildiden.
And he seide, Lo! the puple is oon, and o langage is to alle, and thei han bigunne to make this, nethir thei schulen ceesse of her thouytis, til thei fillen tho in werk; therfor come ye, go we doun,
and scheende we there the tunge of hem, that ech man here not the voys of his neiybore.
And so the Lord departide hem fro that place in to alle londis; and thei cessiden to bielde a cytee.
And therfor the name therof was clepid Babel, for the langage of al erthe was confoundide there; and fro thennus the Lord scaterede hem on the face of alle cuntrees.
These ben the generaciouns of Sem. Sem was of an hundrid yeer whanne he gendride Arfaxath, twey yeer aftir the greet flood.
And Sem lyuede aftir that he gendride Arfaxath fyue hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Forsothe Arfaxath lyuede fyue and thretti yeer, and gendride Sale;
and Arfaxath lyuede aftir that he gendride Sale thre hundride and thre yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Also Sale lyuede thretti yeer, and gendride Heber;
and Sale lyuede after that he gendride Heber foure hundrid and thre yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Sotheli Heber lyuede foure and thretti yeer, and gendride Falech;
and Heber lyuede aftir that he gendride Falech foure hundrid and thretti yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Also Falech lyuede thretti yeer, and gendride Reu;
and Falech lyuede aftir that he gendride Reu two hundrid and nyne yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And Reu lyuede two and thretti yeer, and gendride Saruch;
and Reu lyuede aftir that he gendride Saruch two hundrid and seuene yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Sotheli Saruch lyuede thretti yeer, and gendride Nachor;
and Saruch lyuede aftir that he gendride Nacor two hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
Forsothe Nachor lyuede nyne and twenti yeer, and gendride Thare;
and Nachor lyuede after that he gendride Thare an hundrid and nynetene yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.
And Thare lyuede seuenti yeer, and gendride Abram, and Nachor, and Aran.
Sotheli these ben the generaciouns of Thare. Thare gendride Abram, Nachor, and Aran. Forsothe Aran gendride Loth;
and Aran diede bifore Thare, his fadir, in the lond of his natiuite, in Vr of Caldeis.
Forsothe Abram and Nachor weddiden wyues; the name of the wijf of Abram was Saray, and the name of the wiif of Nachor was Melcha, the douyter of Aran, fadir of Melcha and fadir of Jescha.
Sotheli Saray was bareyn, and hadde no children.
And so Thare took Abram, his sone, and Loth, the sone of Aran his sone, and Saray, his douyter in lawe, the wijf of Abram, his sone, and ledde hem out of Vr of Caldeis, that thei schulen go in to the lond of Chanaan; and thei camen `til to Aran, and dwelliden there.
And the daies of Thare weren maad two hundrid yeer and fyue, and he was deed in Aran.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Abram, Go thou out of thi lond, and of thi kynrede, and of the hous of thi fadir, and come thou in to the lond which Y schal schewe to thee;
and Y schal make thee in to a greet folk, and Y schal blisse thee, and Y schal magnyfie thi name, and thou schalt be blessid;
Y schal blesse hem that blessen thee, and Y schal curse hem that cursen thee; and alle kynredis of erthe schulen be blessid in thee.
And so Abram yede out, as the Lord comaundide hym, and Loth yede with hym. Abram was of `thre scoor yeer and fiftene whanne he yede out of Aran.
And he took Saray, his wijf, and Loth, the sone of his brother, and al the substaunce which thei hadden in possessioun, and the men whiche thei hadden bigete in Aran; and thei yeden out that thei `schulen go in to the loond of Chanaan. And whanne they camen in to it,
Abram passide thorou the lond til to the place of Sichem, and til to the noble valey. Forsothe Chananei was thanne in the lond.
Sotheli the Lord apperide to Abram, and seide to hym, Y schal yyue this lond to thi seed. And Abram bildide there an auter to the Lord, that apperide to hym.
And fro thennus he passide forth to the hil Bethel, that was ayens the eest, and settide there his tabernacle, hauynge Bethel fro the west, and Hay fro the eest. And he bildide also there an auter to the Lord, and inwardli clepide his name.
And Abram yede goynge and goynge forth ouer to the south.
Sotheli hungur was maad in the lond; and Abram yede doun in to Egipt, to be a pilgrime ther, for hungur hadde maistrie in the lond.
And whanne he was nyy to entre in to Egipt, he seide to Saray, his wijf, Y knowe that thou art a fair womman,
and that whanne Egipcians schulen se thee, thei schulen seie, it is his wijf, and thei schulen sle me, and `schulen reserue thee.
Therfor, Y biseche thee, seie thou, that thou art my sistir, that it be wel to me for thee, and that my lijf lyue for loue of thee.
And so whanne Abram hadde entrid in to Egipt, Egipcians sien the womman that sche was ful fair; and the prynces telden to Farao, and preiseden hir anentis him;
and the womman was takun vp in to the hous of Farao.
Forsothe thei vsiden wel Abram for hir; and scheep, and oxun, and assis, and seruauntis, and seruauntessis, and sche assis, and camels weren to hym.
Forsothe the Lord beet Farao and his hous with moste veniaunces, for Saray, the wijf of Abram.
And Farao clepide Abram, and seide to hym, What is it that thou hast do to me? whi schewidist thou not to me, that sche was thi wijf?
for what cause seidist thou, that sche was thi sister, that Y schulde take hir in to wife to me? Now therfor lo! thi wiif; take thou hir, and go.
And Farao comaundide to men on Abram, and thei ledden forth hym, and his wijf, and alle thingis that he hadde.
Therfore Abram stiede fro Egipt, he, and his wijf, and alle thingis that he hadde; and Loth stiede with hym, to the south coost.
Forsothe he was ful riche in possessyoun of siluer and of gold.
And he turnede ayen bi the weye in which he cam fro the south in to Bethel, `til to the place, in which bifore he hadde sett tabernacle, bitwixe Bethel and Hay,
in the place of the auter which he made bifore, and inwardli clepide there the name of the Lord.
But also flockis of scheep, and droues of oxun, and tabernaclis weren to Loth, that was with Abram;
and the lond miyte not take hem, that thei schulden dwelle togidre, for the catel of hem was myche, and thei miyten not dwelle in comyn.
Wherfor also strijf was maad bitwixe the keperis of flockis of Abram and of Loth. Forsothe Chananei and Feresei dwelliden in that lond in that tyme.
Therfor Abram seide to Loth, Y biseche, that no strijf be bitwixe me and thee, and bitwixe my scheepherdis and thi scheepherdis; for we ben britheren.
Lo! al the lond is bifore thee, Y biseche, departe thou fro me; if thou go to the left side, Y schal holde the riyt side; if thou chese the riyt side, Y schal go to the left side.
And so Loth reiside hise iyen, and seiy aboute al the cuntrei of Jordan, which was al moistid, bifor that the Lord distriede Sodom and Gomorre, as paradis of the Lord, and as Egipt, as men comen in to Segor.
And Loth chees to him the cuntre aboute Jordan, and departide fro the eest; and thei weren departid ech fro his brother.
Abram dwellide in the lond of Chanaan; sotheli Loth dwellide in townes aboute Jordan, and wonide in Sodom.
Forsothe men of Sodom weren ful wickid, and synneris greetly bifore the Lord.
And the Lord seide to Abram, aftir that Loth was departid fro him, Reise thin iyen forth riyt, and se fro the place in which thou art now, to the north and south, to the eest and west;
Y schal yyue al the lond which thou seest to thee and to thi seed, til in to with outen ende.
And Y schal make thi seed as the dust of erthe; if ony man may noumbre the dust of erthe, also he schal mowe noumbre thi seed.
Therfor rise thou, and passe thorou the lond in his lengthe and breede, for Y schal yyue it to thee.
Therfor Abram, mouynge his tabernacle, cam and dwellide bisidis the valei of Mambre, which is in Ebron; and he bildide there an auter to the Lord.
Forsothe it was don in that tyme, that Amrafel, kyng of Sennaar, and Ariok, kyng of Ponte, and Chodorlaomor, kyng of Elemytis,
and Tadal, kyng of folkis, bigunnen batel ayens Bara, kyng of Sodom, and ayens Bersa, kyng of Gomorre, and ayens Sennaar, kyng of Adama, and ayens Semeber, kyng of Seboym, and ayens the kyng of Bale; thilke Bale is Segor.
Alle these camen togidre in to the valey of wode, which is now the see of salt.
For in twelue yeer thei seruyden Chodorlaomor, and in the threttenthe yeer thei departiden fro hym.
Therfor Chodorlaomor cam in the fourtenthe yeer, and kyngis that weren with him, and thei `han smyte Rafaym in Astaroth Carnaym, and Susym with hem, and Emym in Sabe Cariathaym,
and Choreis in the hillis of Seir, til to the feldi placis of Faran, which is in wildirnesse.
And thei turneden ayen, and camen til to the welle Mesphath; thilke is Cades. And thei `han smyte al the cuntre of men of Amalec, and Amorrei, that dwellide in Asason Thamar.
And the kyng of Sodom, and the king of Gomorre, and the kyng of Adama, and the kyng of Seboym, also and the kyng of Bale, which is Segor, yeden out, and dressiden scheltrun ayens hem in the valei of wode,
that is, ayens Chodorlaomor, kyng of Elamytis, and Thadal, kyng of folkis, and Amrafel, kyng of Sennaar, and Ariok, kyng of Ponte; foure kyngis ayens fyue.
Forsothe the valey of the wode hadde many pittis of pitche; and so the kyng of Sodom and the kyng of Gomorre turneden the backis, and felden doun there; and thei that leften fledden to the hil.
Sotheli thei token awei al the catel of Sodom and Gomorre, and alle thingis that perteynen to mete, and yeden awei;
also and thei token awey Loth and his catel, the sone of the brother of Abram, which Loth dwellide in Sodom.
And, lo! oon that ascapide, telde to Abram Ebrew, that dwellide in the valei of Mambre of Amorrei, brother of Escol, and brother of Aner; for these maden couenaunt of pees with Abram.
And whanne Abram hadde herd this thing, that is, Loth his brothir takun, he noumbride his borun seruauntis maad redy thre hundrid and eiytene, and pursuede hem `til to Dan.
And whanne his felowis weren departid, he felde on hem in the niyt, and he smoot hem, and pursuede hem `til to Hoba, and Fenyce, which is at the left side of Damask.
And he brouyte ayen al the catel, and Loth his brother with his catel, also wymmen and the puple.
Sotheli the kyng of Sodom yede out in to the metyng of him, after that he turnede ayen fro sleyng of Chodorlaomor, and of kyngis that weren with him, in the valei of Sabe, which is the valey of the kyng.
And sotheli Melchisedech, kyng of Salem, brouyte forth breed and wyn, for he was the preest of hiyeste God;
and he blesside Abram, and seide, Blessid be Abram of hiy God, that made heuene and erthe of nouyt,
and blessid be hiy God, bi whom defendynge, enemyes ben bitakun in thin hondis. And Abram yaf tithis of alle thingis to hym.
Forsothe the kyng of Sodom seide to Abram, Yyue thou the men to me; take thou othir thingis to thee.
And Abram answerde to hym, Y reyse myn hondis to the hiy Lord God,
Lord of heuene and of erthe, that fro the threde of oof til to the layner of the hose I schal not take of alle thingis that ben thine, lest thou seie, I made Abram riche;
out takun these thingis whiche the yonge men eeten, and the partis of men that camen with me, Aner, Escol, and Mambre; these men schulen take her partis.
And so whanne these thingis weren don, the word of the Lord was maad to Abram bi a visioun, and seide, Abram, nyle thou drede, Y am thi defender, and thi meede is ful greet.
And Abram seide, Lord God, what schalt thou yyue to me? Y schal go with oute fre children, and this Damask, sone of Elieser, the procuratour of myn hous, schal be myn eir.
And Abram addide, Sotheli thou hast not youe seed to me, and, lo! my borun seruaunt schal be myn eir.
And anoon the word of the Lord was maad to hym, and seide, This schal not be thin eir, but thou schalt haue hym eir, that schal go out of thi wombe.
And the Lord ledde out Abram, and seide to hym, Biholde thou heuene, and noumbre thou sterris, if thou maist. And the Lord seide to Abram, So thi seed schal be.
Abram bileuede to God, and it was arettid to hym to riytfulnesse.
And God seide to hym, Y am the Lord, that ladde thee out of Vr of Caldeis, that Y schulde yyue this lond to thee, and thou schuldist haue it in possessioun.
And Abram seide, Lord God, wherbi may I wite that Y schal welde it?
And the Lord answerde, and seide, Take thou to me a cow of thre yeer, and a geet of thre yeer, and a ram of thre yeer, a turtle also, and a culuer.
Which took alle these thingis, and departide tho bi the myddis, and settide euer eithir partis ech ayens other; but he departide not the briddis.
And foulis camen doun on the careyns, and Abram drof hem awey.
And whanne the sunne was gon doun, drede felde on Abram, and a greet hidousenesse and derk asaylide him.
And it was seid to hym, Wite thou bifore knowinge, that thi seed schal be pilgrim foure hundrid yeer in a lond not his owne, and thei schulen make hem suget to seruage, and thei schulen turment hem;
netheles Y schal deme the folk to whom thei schulen serue; and aftir these thingis thei schulen go out with greet catel.
Forsothe thou schalt go to thi fadris in pees, and schalt be biried in good age.
Sotheli in the fourthe generacioun thei schulen turne ayen hidir, for the wickidnesses of Amoreis ben not yit fillid, `til to present tyme.
Therfor whanne the sunne was gon doun, a derk myst was maad, and a furneis smokynge apperide, and a laumpe of fier, and passide thorou tho departingis.
In that dai the Lord made a couenaunt of pees with Abram, and seide, Y schal yyue to thi seed this lond, fro the ryuer of Egipt til to the greet ryuer Eufrates; Cyneis,
and Cyneseis, and Cethmoneis, and Etheis,
and Fereseis, and Raphaym, and Amorreis,
and Cananeis, and Gergeseis, and Jebuseis.
Therfor Sarai, wijf of Abram, hadde not gendrid fre children; but sche hadde a seruauntesse of Egipt, Agar bi name, and seide to hir hosebonde, Lo!
the Lord hath closid me, that Y schulde not bere child; entre thou to my seruauntesse, if in hap Y schal take children, nameli of hir. And whanne he assentide to hir preiynge, sche took Agar Egipcian,
hir seruauntesse, after ten yeer aftir that thei begunne to enhabite in the lond of Chanaan, and sche yaf Agar wiif to hir hosebonde.
And Abram entride to Agar; and Agar seiy that sche hadde conseyued, and sche dispiside hir ladi.
And Saray seide to Abram, Thou doist wickidli ayens me; I yaf my seruauntesse in to thi bosum, which seeth, that sche conseyuede, and dispisith me; the Lord deme betwixe me and thee.
And Abram answerde and seide to hir, Lo! thi seruauntesse is in thin hond; vse thou hir as `it likith. Therfor for Sarai turmentide hir, sche fledde awei.
And whanne the aungel of the Lord hadde founde hir bisidis a welle of watir in wildernesse, which welle is in the weie of Sur in deseert,
he seide to hir, Fro whennus comest thou Agar, the seruauntesse of Sarai, and whidur goist thou? Which answerde, Y fle fro the face of Sarai my ladi.
And the aungel of the Lord seide to hir, Turne thou ayen to thi ladi, and be thou mekid vndur hir hondis.
And eft he seide, Y multipliynge schal multiplie thi seed, and it schal not be noumbrid for multitude.
And aftirward he seide, Lo! thou hast conseyued, and thou schalt bere a sone, and thou schalt clepe his name Ismael, for the Lord hath herd thi turment;
this schal be a wielde man; his hond schal be ayens alle men, and the hondis of alle men schulen be ayens him; and he schal sette tabernaclis euene ayens alle his britheren.
Forsothe Agar clepide the name of the Lord that spak to hir, Thou God that seiyest me; for sche seide, Forsothe here Y seiy the hynderere thingis of him that siy me.
Therfor sche clepide thilke pit, the pit of hym that lyueth and seeth me; thilk pit is bitwixe Cades and Barad.
And Agar childide a sone to Abram, which clepide his name Ismael.
Abram was of `eiyti yeere and sixe, whanne Agar childide Ysmael to hym.
Forsothe aftir that Abram bigan to be of nynti yeer and nyne, the Lord apperide to hym, and seide to him, Y am Almyyti God; go thou bifore me, and be thou perfit;
and Y schal sette my couenaunt of pees bitwixe me and thee; and Y schal multiplie thee ful greetli.
And Abram felde doun lowe on his face.
And God seide to hym, Y am, and my couenaunt of pees is with thee, and thou schalt be the fadir of many folkis;
and thi name schal no more be clepid Abram, but thou schalt be clepid Abraham, for Y haue maad thee fadir of many folkis;
and Y schal make thee to wexe ful greetli, and Y schal sette thee in folkis, and kyngis schulen go out of thee;
and Y schal make my couenaunt bitwixe me and thee, and bitwixe thi seed after thee, in her generaciouns, bi euerlastynge bond of pees, that Y be thi God, and of thi seed after thee;
and Y schal yyue to thee and to thi seed after thee the lond of thi pilgrymage, al the lond of Chanaan, in to euerlastynge possessioun, and Y schal be the God of hem.
God seide eft to Abraham, And therfor thou schalt kepe my couenaunt, and thi seed after thee, in her generaciouns.
This is my couenaunt, which ye schulen kepe bitwixe me and you, and thi seed after thee; ech male kynde of you schal be circumcidid,
and ye schulen circumside the fleisch of youre mannes yeerd, that it be in to a signe of boond of pees bytwixe me and you.
A yong child of eiyte daies schal be circumsidid in you, al male kynde in youre generaciouns, as wel a borun seruaunt as a seruaunt bouyt schal be circumsidid, and who euere is of youre kynrede he schal be circumsidid;
and my couenaunt schal be in youre fleisch in to euerlastynge boond of pees.
A man whos fleisch of his yerde schal not be circumsidid, thilke man schal be doon a wei fro his puple; for he made voide my couenaunt.
Also God seide to Abraham, Thou schalt not clepe Saray, thi wijf, Sarai, but Sara;
and Y schal blesse hir, and of hir I schal yyue to thee a sone, whom I schal blesse, and he schal be in to naciouns, and kyngis of puplis schulen be borun of hym.
Abraham felde doun on his face, and leiyede in his hert, and seide, Gessist thou, whethir a sone schal be borun to a man of an hundrid yeer, and Sara of nynti yeer schal bere child?
And he seide to the Lord, Y wolde that Ismael lyue bifore thee.
And the Lord seide to Abraham, Sara, thi wijf, schal bere a sone to thee, and thou schalt clepe his name Ysaac, and Y schal make my couenaunt to hym in to euerlastynge boond of pees, and to his seed aftir hym;
also on Ysmael Y haue herd thee, lo! Y schal blesse him, and Y schal encreesse, and Y schal multiplie him greetli; he schal gendre twelue dukis, and Y schal make hym in to a greet folk.
Forsothe Y schal make my couenaunt to Ysaac, whom Sare schal childe to thee in this tyme in the tother yeer.
And whanne the word of the spekere with hym was endid, God stiede fro Abraham.
Forsothe Abraham took Ismael, his sone, and alle the borun seruauntis of his hous, and alle which he hadde bouyte, alle the malis of alle men of his hous, and circumsidide the fleisch of her yerde, anoon in that dai, as the Lord comaundide him.
Abraham was of nynti yeer and nyne whanne he circumsidide the fleisch of his yeerd,
and Ismael, his sone, hadde fillid threttene yeer in the tyme of his circumsicioun.
Abraham was circumsidid in the same day, and Ismael his sone,
and alle men of his hows, as wel borun seruauntis as bouyt and aliens, weren circumcidid togidre.
Forsothe in the valei of Mambre the Lord apperide to Abraham, sittynge in the dore of his tabernacle, in thilke heete of the dai.
And whanne he hadde reisid his iyen, thre men apperiden to hym, and stoden nyy hym. And whanne he hadde seyn hem, he ran fro the dore of his tabernacle in to the meting of hem, and he worschipide on erthe,
and seide, Lord, if Y haue founde grace in thin iyen, passe thou not thi seruaunt,
but I schal brynge a litil watir, and youre feet be waischid, and reste ye vndur the tre;
and Y schal sette a mussel of breed, and youre herte be coumfortid; aftirward ye schulen passe; for herfor ye bowiden to youre seruaunt. Whiche seiden, Do thou as thou hast spoke.
Abraham hastide in to the tabernacle, to Sare, and seide to hir, Hast thou, meddle thou thre half buschelis of clene flour; and make thou looues bakun vndur aischis.
Forsothe he ran to the droue of beestis, and took therof a calf moost tendre and best, and yaf to a child, which hastide, and sethede the calfe;
and he took botere, and mylk, and the calf which he hadde sode, and settide bifore hem; forsothe Abraham stood bisidis hem vndur the tre.
And whanne thei hadden ete, thei seiden to hym, Where is Sare thi wijf? He answerde, Lo! sche is in the tabernacle.
To whom the Lord seide, Y schal turne ayen, and Y schal come to thee in this tyme, if Y lyue; and Sare, thi wijf, schal haue a sone. Whanne this was herd, Sare leiyede bihynde the dore of the tabernacle.
Forsothe bothe weren olde, and of greet age, and wommans termes ceessiden to be maad to Sare.
And she leiyede, seiynge pryueli, after that Y wexede eld, and my lord is eld, schal Y yyue diligence to lust?
Forsothe the Lord seide to Abraham, Whi leiyeth Sare, thi wijf, seiynge, whether Y an eld womman schal bere child verili?
whether ony thing is hard to God? Bi the biheeste Y schal turne ayen to thee in this same tyme, if Y lyue; and Sara schal haue a sone.
Sare was aferd for drede, and denyede, seiynge, Y leiyede not. Forsothe the Lord seide, It is not so, but thou leiyedist.
Therfor whanne the men hadden risen fro thennus, thei dressiden the iyen ayens Sodom; and Abraham yede to gidre, ledynge hem forth.
And the Lord seide, Wher Y mowe hele fro Abraham what thingis Y schal do,
sithen he schal be in to a greet folk and moost strong, and alle naciouns of erthe schulen be blessid in hym?
For Y woot that Abraham schal comaunde hise children, and his hows after hym, that thei kepe the weie of the Lord, and that thei do riytfulnesse and dom, that the Lord bringe for Abraham alle thingis whiche he spak to Abraham.
And so the Lord seide, The cry of men of Sodom and of men of Gomorre is multiplied, and her synne is agreggid greetli; Y schal come doun,
and schal se whether thei han fillid in werk the cry that cam to me, that Y wite whether it is not so.
And thei turneden han fro thennus, and yeden to Sodom. Abraham sotheli stood yit bifore the Lord,
and neiyede, and seide, Whether thou schalt leese a iust man with the wickid man?
if fifti iust men ben in the citee, schulen thei perische togidere, and schalt thou not spare that place for fifti iust men, if thei ben ther ynne?
Fer be it fro thee that thou do this thing, and sle a iust man with a wickid man, and that a iust man be maad as a wickid man; this is not thin that demest al erthe; thou schalt not make this doom.
And the Lord seide to him, If Y schal fynde in Sodom fifti iust men in the myddis of the citee, Y schal foryyue to al the place for hem.
Abraham answerde and seide, For Y bigan onys, Y schal speke to my Lord, sithen Y am dust and aische;
what if lesse than fifti iust men bi fyue ben, schalt thou do a wey al the cite for fyue and fourti? And the Lord seide, Y schal not do a wei, if I schal fynde fyue and fourti there.
And eft Abraham seide to hym, But if fourti ben there, what schalt thou do? The Lord seide, Y schal not smyte for fourti.
Abraham seide, Lord, Y biseche, take thou not to indignacioun, if Y speke; what if thretti be foundun there? The Lord answerde, Y schal not do, if Y schal fynde thretti there.
Abraham seide, For Y bigan onys, Y schal speke to my Lord; what if twenti be foundun there? The Lord seide, Y schal not sle for twenti.
Abraham seide, Lord, Y biseche, be thou not wrooth, if Y speke yit onys; what if ten be founden there? The Lord seide, Y schal not do a wey for ten.
The Lord yede forth, after that he ceesside to speke to Abraham, and Abraham turnede ayen in to his place.
And tweyne aungels camen to Sodom in the euentide, while Loth sat in the yatis of the citee. And whanne he hadde seyn hem, he roos, and yede ayens hem, and worschipide lowe to erthe,
and seide, My lordis, Y biseche, bowe ye in to the hous of youre child, and dwelle ye there; waische ye youre feet, and in the morewtid ye schulen go in to youre weie. Whiche seiden, Nay, but we schulen dwelle in the street.
He constreynede hem greetli, that thei schulden turne to hym. And whanne thei weren entrid in to his hous, he made a feeste, he bakide therf breed, and thei eten.
Forsothe bifore that thei yeden to sleepe, men of the citee compassiden his hows, fro a child `til to an eld man, al the puple togidre;
and thei clepiden Loth, and seiden to him, Where ben the men that entriden to thee to nyyt? brynge hem out hidur, that we `knowe hem.
And Loth yede out to hem `bihynde the bak, and closide the dore,
and seide, Y biseche, nyle ye, my britheren, nyle ye do this yuel.
Y haue twey douytris, that knewen not yit man; Y schal lede out hem to you, and mys vse ye hem as it plesith you, so that ye doon noon yuel to these men, for thei entriden vndur the schadewe of my roof.
And thei seiden, Go thou fro hennus. And eft thei seiden, Thou entridist as a comelyng; wher that thou deme? therfor we schulen turment thee more than these. And thei diden violentli to Loth ful greetli. Thanne it was nyy that thei wolden breke the doris; and lo!
the men puttiden hoond, and ledden in Loth to hem, and thei closiden the dore.
And thei smyten with blyndenesse hem that weren withoutforth, fro the leest til to the moost; so that thei myyten not fynde the dore.
Forsothe thei seiden to Loth, Hast thou here ony man of thine, hosebonde of thi douyter, ethir sones, ethir douytris; lede thou out of this citee alle men that ben thine,
for we schulen do a wey this place, for the cry of hem encreesside bifor the Lord, which sente vs that we leese hem.
And so Loth yede out, and spak to the hosebondys of his douytris, that schulden take hise douytris, and seide, Rise ye, and go ye out of this place; for the Lord schal do awey this citee. And he was seyn to hem to speke as pleiynge.
And whanne the morewtid was, the aungels constreyneden hym, and seiden, Rise thou, and take thi wijf, and thi twey douytris whiche thou hast, lest also thou perische to gidere in the synne of the citee.
While he dissymelide, thei token his hond, and the hond of his wijf, and of his twey doutris; for the Lord sparide hym.
And thei ledden out hym, and settiden with out the citee. There thei spaken to him, and seiden, Saue thou thi lijf; nyle thou biholde bihynde thi bac, nether stond thou in al the cuntre aboute, but make thee saaf in the hil; lest also thou perische togidere.
And Loth seide to hem, My lord, Y biseche,
for thi seruaunt hath founde grace bifore thee, and thou hast magnyfied thi grace and mercy, which thou hast do with me, that thou schuldist saue my lijf; Y may not be saued in the hil, lest perauenture yuel take me, and Y die;
a litil citee is here bisidis, to which Y may fle, and Y schal be saued ther ynne; where it is not a litil citee? and my soule schal lyue ther ynne.
And he seide to Loth, Lo! also in this Y haue resseyued thi preieris, that Y distrye not the citee, for which thou hast spoke;
haste thou, and be thou saued there, for Y may not do ony thing til thou entre thidur. Therfor the name of that citee was clepid Segor.
The sunne roos on erthe, and Loth entride in to Segor.
Therfor the Lord reynede on Sodom and Gomorre brynston and fier, fro the Lord fro heuene,
and distriede these citees, and al the cuntrey aboute; he destriede alle enhabiters of citees, and all grene thingis of erthe.
And his wijf lokide abac, and was turned in to an ymage of salt.
Forsothe Abraham risynge eerly, where he stood bifore with the Lord, bihelde Sodom and Gomorre,
and al the lond of that cuntrey; and he seiy a deed sparcle stiynge fro erthe, as the smoke of a furneis.
For whanne God distriede the citees of that cuntrey, he hadde mynde of Abraham, and delyuerede Loth fro destriynge of the citees in whiche he dwellide.
And Loth stiede fro Segor, and dwellide in the hil, and hise twey douytris with him, for he dredde to dwelle in Segor; and he dwellide in a denne, he and his twey douytris with hym.
And the more douytre seide to the lasse, Oure fadre is eld, and no man is left in erthe, that may entre to vs, bi the custom of al erthe;
come thou, make we him drunkun of wyn, and slepe we with him, that we moun kepe seed of oure fadir.
And so thei yauen to her fadir to drynke wyn in that nyyt, and the more douyter entrede, and slepte with hir fadir; and he feelide not, nethir whanne the douytir lay doun, nether whanne sche roos.
And in the tothir dai the more douytir seide to the lasse, Lo! Y slepte yistirdai with my fadir, yyue we to hym to drynk wyn also in this nyyt; and thou schalt slepe with hym, that we saue seed of oure fadir.
And thei yauen to her fadir also in that nyyt to drynke wyn, and the lesse douytir entride, and slepte with him; and sotheli he feelide not thanne whanne sche lay doun, nether whanne sche roos.
Therfor the twei douytris of Loth conseyuede of hir fadir.
And the more douytre childide a sone, and clepide his name Moab; he is the fadir of men of Moab `til in to present dai.
And the lesse douyter childide a sone, and clepide his name Amon, that is, the sone of my puple; he is the fadir of men of Amon til to day.
Abraham yede forth fro thennus in to the lond of the south, and dwellide bitwixe Cades and Sur, and was a pilgrym in Geraris;
and he seide of Sare, his wijf, Sche is my sistir. Therfor Abymalec, kyng of Gerare, sente, and took hir.
Sotheli God cam to Abymalec bi a sweuene in the nyyt, and seide to hym, Lo! thou schalt die, for the wooman which thou hast take, for sche hath an hosebond.
Forsothe Abymalech touchide not hir; and he seide, Lord, whether thou schalt sle folc vnkunnynge and iust?
Whether he seide not to me, Sche is my sistir, and sche seide, He is my brother? In the symplenesse of myn herte, and in the clennesse of myn hondis Y dide this.
And the Lord seide to hym, And Y woot that thou didist bi symple herte, and therfor Y kepte thee, lest thou didist synne ayens me, and I suffride not that thou touchidist hir;
now therfor yelde thou the wijf to hir hosebonde, for he is a profete; and he schal preye for thee, and thou schalt lyue; sotheli if thou nylte yelde, wite thou that thou schalt die bi deeth, thou and alle thingis that ben thine.
And anoon Abynalech roos bi nyyt, and clepide alle his seruauntis, and spak alle these wordis in the eeris of hem; and alle men dredden greetli.
Sotheli Abymalec clepide also Abraham, and seide to hym, What hast thou do to vs? what synneden we ayens thee, for thou hast brouyt in on me and on my rewme a greuouse synne? thou hast do to vs whiche thingis thou ouytist not do.
And eft Abimalech axide, and seide, What thing seiyist thou, that thou woldist do this?
Abraham answerde, Y thouyte with me, and seide, in hap the drede of God is not in this place; and thei schulen sle me for my wijf;
in other maner forsothe and sche is my sister verili, the douyter of my fadir, and not the douyter of my moder; and Y weddide hir in to wijf;
sotheli aftir that God ladde me out of the hous of my fadir, Y seide to hir, Thou schalt do this mercy with me in ech place to which we schulen entre; thou schalt seie, that Y am thi brother.
Therfore Abymelech took scheep, and oxun, and seruauntis, and handmaydenes, and yaf to Abraham; and he yeldide to him Sare, `his wijf, and seide, The lond is bifor you;
dwelle thou, where euere it plesith thee. Forsothe Abymelech seide to Sare, Lo!
Y yaf a thousand platis of siluer to thi brother; this schal be to thee in to hiling of iyen to al men that ben with thee; and whider euere thou goist, haue thou mynde that thou art takun.
Sotheli for Abraham preiede, God curide Abymelech, and his wijf, and handmaydens, and thei childiden;
for God hadde closid ech wombe of the hows of Abymelech, for Sare, the wijf of Abraham.
Forsothe God visitide Sare, as he bihiyte, and fillide tho thingis, that he spak.
And sche conseyuede, and childide a sone in hir eeld, in the tyme wherynne God biforseide to hir.
And Abraham clepide the name of his sone, whom Sare childide to him, Ysaac.
And Abraham circumcidide hym in the eiyte dai, as God comaundide to him,
whanne he was of an hundrid yeer; for Ysaac was borun in this age of the fadir.
And Sare seide, The Lord made leiyynge to me, and who euer schal here schal leiye with me.
And eft sche seide, Who schulde here, and bileue to Abraham, that Sare schulde yyue soukyng to a sone, whom sche childide to him now an eld man?
Therfor the child encreesside, and was wenyd; and Abraham made a greet feeste in the dai of his wenyng.
And whanne Sare seiy the sone of Agar Egipcian pleiynge with Ysaac hir sone, sche seide to Abraham,
Cast thou out the handmayde and hir sone; for the sone of the handmayde schal not be eir with my sone Ysaac.
Abraham took this heuyli for his sone;
and God seide to hym, Be it not seyn scharp to thee on the child, and on thin handmayde; alle thingis whiche Sare seith to thee, here thou hir vois, for in Isaac seed schal be clepid to thee;
but also I schal make the sone of the handmaid in to a greet folk, for he is thi seed.
And so Abraham roos eerli, and took breed, and a botel of watir, and puttide on hir schuldre, and bitook the child, and lefte hir; and whanne sche hadde go, sche yede out of the weie in the wildirnesse of Bersabee.
And whanne the watir in the botel was endid, sche castide awei the child vndur a tre that was there;
and sche yede awei, and sche sat euene ayens as fer as a bowe may caste; for sche seide, Y schal not se the child diynge; and sche sat ayens, and reiside hir vois, and wepte.
Forsothe the Lord herde the vois of the child, and the aungel of the Lord clepide Agar fro heuene, and seide, What doist thou, Agar? nyle thou drede, for God hath herd the vois of the child fro the place where ynne he is.
Rise thou, and take the child, and holde his hoond; for Y schal make hym in to a greet folc.
And God openyde hir iyen, and sche seiy a pit of watir, and sche yede, and fillide the botel, and sche yaf drynk to the child;
and was with him, and he encresside, and dwellide in wildernesse, and he was maad a yong man an archer,
and dwellide in the deseert of Faran; and his modir took to him a wijf of the lond of Egipt.
In the same tyme Abymelech, and Ficol, prince of his oost, seide to Abraham, God is with thee in alle thingis whiche thou doist;
therfore swere thou bi God that thou noye not me, and myn eiris, and my kynrede; but bi the mersi whych Y dide to thee, do thou to me, and to the lond in which thou lyuedist a comelyng.
And Abraham seide, Y schal swere.
And he blamyde Abymelech for the pit of watir, which hise seruauntis token awey bi violence.
And Abymelech answerde, I wiste not who dide this thing, but also thou schewidist not to me, and Y herde not outakun to dai.
And so Abraham took scheep and oxun, and yaf to Abymalech, and bothe smyten a boond of pees.
And Abraham settide seuene ewe lambren of the flok asidis half.
And Abymelech seide to hym, What wolen these seuene ewe lambren to hem silf, whiche thou madist stonde asidis half?
And he seide, Thou schalt take of myn hond seuene ewe lambren, that tho be in to witnessyng to me, for Y diggide this pit.
Therfor thilke place was clepid Bersabee, for euere eithir swore there;
and thei maden boond of pees for the pit of an ooth.
Forsothe Abymelech roos, and Ficol, prince of his chyualrie, and thei turneden ayen in to the lond of Palestyns. Sotheli Abraham plauntide a wode in Bersabee, and inwardli clepide there the name of euerlastinge God;
and he was an erthetiliere ether a comelynge of the lond of Palestynes in many dayes.
And aftir that these thingis weren don, God assaiede Abraham, and seide to hym, Abraham! Abraham! He answerde, Y am present.
God seide to him, Take thi `sone oon gendrid, whom thou louest, Ysaac; and go into the lond of visioun, and offre thou hym there in to brent sacrifice, on oon of the hillis whiche Y schal schewe to thee.
Therfor Abraham roos bi niyt, and sadlide his asse, and ledde with hym twey yonge men, and Ysaac his sone; and whanne he hadde hewe trees in to brent sacrifice, he yede to the place which God hadde comaundid to him.
Forsothe in the thridde dai he reiside hise iyen, and seiy a place afer;
and he seide to hise children, Abide ye here with the asse, Y and the child schulen go thidur; and aftir that we han worschipid, we schulen turne ayen to you.
And he took the trees of brent sacrifice, and puttide on Ysaac his sone; forsothe he bar fier, and a swerd in hise hondis. And whanne thei tweyne yeden togidere, Isaac seide to his fadir, My fadir!
And he answerde, What wolt thou, sone? He seide, Lo! fier and trees, where is the beeste of brent sacrifice?
Abraham seide, My sone, God schal puruey to hym the beeste of brent sacrifice.
Therfor thei yeden to gidere, and camen to the place whiche God hadde schewid to hym, in which place Abraham bildide an auter, and dresside trees a boue; and whanne he hadde bounde to gidere Ysaac, his sone, he puttide Ysaac in the auter, on the heep of trees.
And he helde forth his hond, and took the swerd to sacrifice his sone.
And lo! an aungel of the Lord criede fro heuene, and seide, Abraham! Abraham!
Which answerde, I am present. And the aungel seide to hym, Holde thou not forth thin honde on the child, nether do thou ony thing to him; now Y haue knowe that thou dredist God, and sparidist not thin oon gendrid sone for me.
Abraham reiside hise iyen, and he seiy `bihynde his bak a ram cleuynge bi hornes among breris, which he took, and offride brent sacrifice for the sone.
And he clepide the name of that place, The Lord seeth; wherfore it is seyd, til to dai, The Lord schal see in the hil.
Forsothe the aungel of the Lord clepide Abraham the secounde tyme fro heuene,
and seide, The Lord seith, Y haue swore bi my silf, for thou hast do this thing, and hast not sparid thin oon gendrid for me,
Y schal blesse thee, and Y schal multiplie thi seed as the sterris of heuene, and as grauel which is in the brynk of the see; thi seed schal gete the yatis of hise enemyes;
and alle the folkis of erthe schulen be blessid in thi seed, for thou obeiedist to my vois.
Abraham turnede ayen to hise children, and thei yeden to Bersabee to gidere, and he dwellide there.
And so whanne these thingis weren don, it was teld to Abraham that also Melcha hadde bore sones to Nachor his brother;
Hus the firste gendrid, and Buz his brothir, and Chamuhel the fadir of Sireis,
and Cased, and Asan, and Feldas,
and Jedlaf, and Batuhel, of whom Rebecca was borun; Melcha childide these eiyte to Nachor brother of Abraham.
Forsothe his concubyn, Roma bi name, childide Thabee, and Gaon, and Thaas, and Maacha.
Forsothe Sare lyuede an hundrid and seuene and twenti yeer,
and diede in the citee of Arbee, which is Ebron, in the lond of Chanaan; and Abraham cam to biweyle and biwepe hir.
And whanne he hadde rise fro the office of the deed bodi, he spak to the sones of Heth, and seide,
Y am a comelyng and a pilgrym anentis you; yyue ye to me riyt of sepulcre with you, that Y birie my deed body.
And the sones of Heth answeriden, and seiden, Lord, here thou vs;
thou art the prince of God anentis vs; birie thou thi deed bodi in oure chosun sepulcris, and no man schal mow forbede thee, that ne thou birie thi deed bodi in the sepulcre of him.
And Abraham roos, and worschipide the puple of the lond, that is, the sones of Heth.
And he seide to hem, If it plesith youre soule that Y birie my deed bodi, here ye me, and preie ye for me to Efron, the sone of Seor,
that he yyue to me the double caue, whiche he hath in the vttirmoste part of his feeld; for sufficiaunt money yyue he it to me bifore you into possessioun of sepulcre.
Forsothe Efron dwellide in the myddis of the sones of Heth. And Efron answerde to Abraham, while alle men herden that entriden bi the yate of that citee,
and seide, My lord, it schal not be doon so, but more herkne thou that that Y seie; Y yyue to thee the feeld, and the denne which is therine, while the sones of my puple ben present; birie thou thi deed bodi.
Abraham worschipide bifor the Lord, and bifor the puple of the lond,
and he spak to Efron, while his puple stood aboute, Y biseche, that thou here me; Y schal yyue money for the feeld, resseyue thou it, and so Y schal birie my deed bodi in the feeld.
And Efron answerde, My lord,
here thou me, the lond which thou axist is worth foure hundrid siclis of siluer, that is the prijs bitwixe me and thee, but hou myche is this? birie thou thi deed bodi.
And whanne Abraham hadde herd this, he noumbride the monei which Efron axide, while the sones of Heth herden, foure hundrid siclis of siluer, and of preuyd comyn monei.
And the feeld that was sumtyme of Efron, in which feeld was a double denne, biholdinge to Mambre, as wel thilke feeld as the denne and alle the trees therof, in alle termes therof bi cumpas, was confermed to Abraham in to possessioun,
while the sones of Heth seiyen and alle men that entriden bi the yate of that citee.
And so Abraham biriede Sare, his wijf, in the double denne of the feeld, that bihelde to Mambre; this is Ebron in the lond of Chanaan.
And the feeld, and the denne that was therynne, was confermyd of the sones of Heth to Abraham, in to possessioun of sepulcre.
Forsothe Abraham was eld, and of many daies, and the Lord hadde blessid hym in alle thingis.
And he seide to the eldere seruaunt of his hows, that was souereyn on alle thingis that he hadde, Put thou thin hond vndur myn hipe,
that Y coniure thee bi the Lord God of heuene and of erthe, that thou take not a wijf to my sone of the douytris of Chanaan, among whiche Y dwelle;
but that thou go to my lond and kynrede, and therof take a wijf to my sone Ysaac.
The seruaunt aunswerde, If the womman nyle come with me in to this lond, whether Y owe lede ayen thi sone to the place, fro which thou yedist out?
Abraham seide, Be war, lest ony tyme thou lede ayen thidur my sone;
the Lord of heuene that took me fro the hows of my fadir, and fro the lond of my birthe, which spak to me, and swoor, and seide, Y schal yyue this lond to thi seed, he schal sende his aungel bifore thee, and thou schalt take fro thennus a wijf to my sone; forsothe if the womman nyle sue thee,
thou schalt not be holdun bi the ooth; netheles lede not ayen my sone thidur.
Therfore the seruaunt puttide his hond vndur the hipe of Abraham, his lord, and swoor to him on this word.
And he took ten camels of the floc of his lord, and yede forth, and bar with him of alle the goodis of his lord; and he yede forth, and cam to Mesopotanye, to the citee of Nachor.
And whanne he hadde maad the camels to reste with out the citee, bisidis the pit of watir, in the euentid, in that tyme in which wymmen ben wont to go out to drawe watir,
he seide, Lord God of my lord Abraham, Y biseche, meete with me to dai, and do mersi with my lord Abraham.
Lo! Y stonde nyy the welle of watir, and the douytris of enhabiters of this citee schulen go out to drawe watir;
therfor the damysel to which Y schal seie, Bowe doun thi watir pot that Y drynke, and schal answere, Drynke thou, but also Y schal yyue drynke to thi camels, thilke it is which thou hast maad redi to thi seruaunt Ysaac; and bi this Y schal vndirstonde that thou hast do mersi with my lord Abraham.
And he hadde not yit fillid the wordis with ynne hym silf, and lo! Rebecca, the douytir of Batuel, sone of Melcha, wijf of Nachor, brothir of Abraham, yede out, hauynge a watir pot in hir schuldre;
a damysel ful comeli, and faireste virgyn, and vnknowun of man. Sotheli sche cam doun to the welle, and fillide the watir pot, and turnide ayen.
And the seruaunt mette hir, and seide, Yyue thou to me a litil of the watir of thi pot to drynke.
Which answerde, Drynke thou, my lord. And anoon sche dide doun the watir pot on hir schuldre, and yaf drynk to hym.
And whanne he hadde drunke, sche addide, But also Y schal drawe watir to thi camelis, til alle drynken.
And sche helde out the watir pot in trouyis, and ran ayen to the pit, to drawe watir, and sche yaf watir drawun to alle the camels.
Sotheli he bihelde hir priueli, and wolde wite whether the Lord hadde sped his wei, ethir nay.
Therfor after that the camels drunken, the man brouyte forth goldun eere ryngis, weiynge twei siclis, and as many bies of the arm, in the weiyte of ten siclis.
And he seide to hir, Whos douyter art thou? schewe thou to me, is ony place in the hows of thi fadir to dwelle?
Which answerde, Y am the douyter of Batuel, sone of Nachor, whom Melcha childide to him.
And sche addide, seiynge, Also ful myche of prouendre and of hey is at vs, and a large place to dwelle.
The man bowide hym silf,
and worschipide the Lord, and seide, Blessid be the Lord God of my lord Abraham, which God took not aweie his mersy and treuthe fro my lord, and ledde me bi riyt weie in to the hous of the brother of my lord.
And so the damesel ran, and telde in the hous of hir modir alle thingis whiche sche hadde herd.
Sotheli Rebecca hadde a brothir, Laban bi name, whiche yede out hastili to the man, where he was with out forth.
And whanne he hadde seyn the eere ryngis and byes of the arm in the hondis of his sister, and hadde herd alle the wordis of hir tellynge, the man spak to me these thingis, he cam to the man that stood bisidis the camels, and nyy the welle of watir,
and seide to him, Entre thou, the blessid of the Lord; whi stondist thou with outforth? I haue maad redi the hows, and a place to thi camels.
And he brouyte hym in to the ynne, and unsadlide the camels, and yaf prouendre, and hey, and watir to waische the feet of camels, and of men that camen with hym.
And breed was set forth in his siyt, which seide, Y schal not ete til Y speke my wordis. He answerde to the man, Speke thou.
And the man seide, Y am the seruaunt of Abraham,
and the Lord hath blessid my lord greetli, and he is maad greet; and God yaf to hym scheep, and oxun, siluer, and gold, seruauntis, and handmaides, camels, and assis.
And Sare, `the wijf of my lord, childide a sone to my lord in his eelde, and he yaf alle thingis that he hadde to that sone.
And my lord chargide me greetli, and seide, Thou schalt not take to my sone a wijf of the douytris of Canaan, in whos lond Y dwelle,
but thou schalt go to the hous of my fadir, and of myn kynrede thou schalt take a wijf to my sone.
Forsothe Y answerde to my lord, What if the womman nyle come with me?
He seide, The Lord in whose siyt Y go, schal sende his aungel with thee, and he schal dresse thi weie; and thou schalt take a wijf to my sone of my kynrede, and of my fadris hows.
Thou schalt be innocent fro my curs, whanne thou comest to my kynesmen, and thei yyuen not `the womman to thee.
Therfor Y cam to day to the welle of watir, and Y seide, Lord God of my lord Abraham, if thou hast dressid my weie in which Y go now, lo!
Y stonde bisidis the welle of watir, and the maide that schal go out to drawe watir herith me, yyue thou to me a litil of water to drynke of thi pot,
and seith to me, And thou drynke, and Y schal drawe watir to thi camels, thilke is the womman which the Lord hath maad redi to the sone of my lord.
While Y turnede in thouyte these thingis with me, Rebecca apperide, comynge with a pot which sche bare in the schuldre; and sche yede doun to the welle, and drowe watir. And Y seide to hir, Yyue thou a litil to me to drynke; and sche hastide,
and dide doun the pot of the schuldre, and seide to me, And thou drynke, and Y schal yyue drynke to thi camels; Y drank, and watride the camels.
And Y axide hir, and seide, Whos douytir art thou? Which answerde, Y am the douytir of Batuel, sone of Nachor, whom Melcha childide to him. And so Y hangide eere ryngis to ourne hir face, and Y puttide bies of the arm in hir hondis,
and lowliche Y worschipide the Lord, and Y blessid the Lord God of my lord Abraham, which God ledde me bi riyt weie, that Y schulde take the douytir of the brothir of my lord to his sone.
Wherfor if ye don mercy and treuthe with `my lord, schewe ye to me; ellis if othir thing plesith, also seie ye this, that Y go to the riyt side ethir to the left side.
Laban and Batuel answeriden, The word is gon out of the Lord; we moun not speke ony other thing with thee without his plesaunce.
Lo! Rebecca is bifore thee; take thou hir, and go forth, and be sche wijf of the sone of thi lord, as the Lord spak.
And whanne the child of Abraham hadde herd this, he felde doun, and worschipide the Lord in erthe.
And whanne vessels of siluer, and of gold, and clothis weren brouyt forth, he yaf tho to Rebecca for yifte, and he yaf yiftis to hir britheren, and modir.
And whanne a feeste was maad, thei eeten and drunken to gider, and dwelliden there. Forsothe the child roos eerli, and spak, Delyuere ye me, that Y go to my lord.
Hir britheren and modir answerden, The damesele dwelle nameli ten daies at vs, and aftirward sche schal go forth.
The child seide, Nyle ye holde me, for the Lord hath dressid my weie; delyuere ye me, that I go to my lord.
And thei seiden, Clepe we the damysele, and axe we hir wille.
And whanne sche was clepid, and cam, thei axiden, Wolt thou go with this man?
And sche seide, Y schal go. Therfor they delyueriden hir, and hir nurse, and the seruaunt of Abraham, and hise felowis, and wischiden prosperitees to her sister,
and seiden, Thou art oure sister, encreesse thou in to a thousand thousandis, and thi seed gete the yatis of hise enemyes.
Therfor Rebecca and hir damesels stieden on the camels, and sueden the man, which turnede ayen hasteli to his lord.
In that tyme Ysaac walkide bi the weie that ledith to the pit, whos name is of hym that lyueth and seeth; for he dwellide in the south lond.
And he yede out to thenke in the feeld, for the dai was `bowid thanne; and whanne he hadde reisid the iyen, he seiy camels comynge afer.
And whanne Ysaac was seyn, Rebecca liyte doun of the camel,
and seide to the child, Who is that man that cometh bi the feeld in to the metyng of vs? And the child seide to hir, He is my lord. And sche took soone a mentil, and hilide hir.
Forsothe the seruaunt tolde to his lord Ysaac alle thingis whiche he hadde do;
which Ysaac ledde hir in to the tabernacle of Sare, his modir, and took hir to wijf; and so myche he louede hir, that he temperide the sorewe which bifelde of the deeth of the modir.
Forsothe Abraham weddide another wijf, Ceture bi name,
which childide to him Samram, and Jexan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboth, and Sue.
Also Jexan gendride Saba and Dadan. Forsothe the sones of Dadan weren Asurym, and Lathusym, and Laomym.
And sotheli of Madian was borun Efa, and Ofer, and Enoth, and Abida, and Heldaa; alle these weren the sones of Cethure.
And Abraham yaf alle thingis whiche he hadde in possessioun to Isaac;
sotheli he yaf yiftis to the sones of concubyns; and Abraham, while he lyuede yit, departide hem fro Ysaac, his sone, to the eest coost.
Forsothe the daies of lijf of Abraham weren an hundrid and `fyue and seuenti yeer;
and he failide, and diede in good eelde, and of greet age, and ful of daies, and he was gaderid to his puple.
And Ysaac and Ismael, his sones, birieden him in the double denne, which is set in the feeld of Efron, sone of Seor Ethei,
euene ayens Mambre, which denne he bouyte of the sones of Heth; and he was biried there, and Sare his wijf.
And aftir the deeth of Abraham God blesside Isaac his sone, which dwellide bisidis the pit bi name of hym that lyueth and seeth.
These ben the generaciouns of Ismael, sone of Abraham, whom Agar Egipcian, seruauntesse of Sare, childide to Abraham;
and these ben the names of the sones of Ismael, in her names and generaciouns. The firste gendride of Ismael was Nabaioth, aftirward Cedar, and Abdeel, and Mabsan,
and Masma, and Duma, and Massa,
and Adad, and Thema, and Ithur, and Nafir, and Cedma.
These weren the sones of Ismael, and these weren names by castels and townes of hem, twelue princes of her lynagis.
And the yeeris of lijf of Ismael weren maad an hundrid and seuene and thretti, and he failide, and diede, and was put to his puple.
Forsothe he enhabitide fro Euila til to Sur, that biholdith Egipt, as me entrith in to Assiriens; he diede bifore alle his britheren.
Also these ben the generaciouns of Ysaac sone of Abraham. Abraham gendride Isaac,
and whanne Isaac was of fourti yeer, he weddide a wijf, Rebecca, douyter of Batuel, of Sirie of Mesopotanye, the sistir of Laban.
And Isaac bisouyte the Lord for his wijf, for sche was bareyn; and the Lord herde him, and yaf conseiuyng to Rebecca.
But the litle children weren hurtlid togidre in hir wombe; and sche seide, If it was so to comynge to me, what nede was it to conseyue? And sche yede and axide counsel of the Lord,
which answerde, and seide, Twei folkis ben in thi wombe, and twei puplis schulen be departid fro thi wombe, and a puple schal ouercome a puple, and the more schal serue the lesse.
Thanne the tyme of childberyng cam, and lo! twei children weren foundun in hir wombe.
He that yede out first was reed, and al rouy in the manere of a skyn; and his name was clepid Esau.
Anoon the tothir yede out, and helde with the hond the heele of the brother; and therfore he clepide him Jacob. Isaac was sixti yeer eeld, whanne the litle children weren borun.
And whanne thei weren woxun, Esau was maad a man kunnynge of huntyng, and a man erthe tilier; forsothe Jacob was a symple man, and dwellide in tabernaclis.
Isaac louyde Esau, for he eet of the huntyng of Esau; and Rebecca louyde Jacob.
Sotheli Jacob sethide potage; and whanne Esau cam weri fro the feld,
he seide to Jacob, Yyue thou to me of this reed sething, for Y am ful weri; for which cause his name was clepid Edom.
And Jacob seide to him, Sille to me the riyt of the first gendrid childe.
He answerde, Lo! Y die, what schulen the firste gendrid thingis profite to me?
Jacob seide, therfor swere thou to me. Therfor Esau swoor, and selde the firste gendrid thingis.
And so whanne he hadde take breed and potage, Esau eet and drank, and yede forth, and chargide litil that he hadde seld the riyt of the firste gendrid child.
Forsothe for hungur roos on the lond, aftir thilke bareynesse that bifelde in the daies of Abraham, Isaac yede forth to Abymelech, kyng of Palestyns, in Gerara.
And the Lord apperide to hym, and seide, Go not doun in to Egipt, but reste thou in the lond which Y schal seie to thee,
and be thou a pilgrym ther ynne; and Y schal be with thee, and Y schal blesse thee; for Y schal yyue alle these cuntrees to thee and to thi seed, and Y schal fille the ooth which Y bihiyte to Abraham, thi fadir.
And Y schal multiplie thi seed as the sterris of heuene, and Y schal yyue alle these thingis to thin eyris, and alle folkis of erthe schulen be blessid in thi seed, for Abraham obeide to my vois,
and kepte `my preceptis and comaundementis, and kepte cerymonyes and lawis.
And so Ysaac dwellide in Geraris.
And whanne he was axid of men of that place of his wijf, he answarde, Sche is my sistir; for he dredde to knowleche that sche was felouschipid to hym in matrymonye, and gesside lest peraduenture thei wolden sle him for the fairnesse of hir.
And whanne ful many daies weren passid, and he dwellide there, Abymelech, kyng of Palestyns, bihelde bi a wyndow, and seiy hym pleiynge with Rebecca, his wijf.
And whanne Isaac was clepid, the kyng seide, It is opyn, that sche is thi wijf; whi liedist thou, that sche was thi sistir? Isaac answerde, Y dredde, lest Y schulde die for hir.
And Abymelech seide, Whi hast thou disseyued vs? Sum man of the puple myyte do letcherie with thi wijf, and thou haddist brouyt in greuous synne on vs. And the kyng comaundide to al the puple,
and seide, He that touchith the wijf of this man schal die bi deeth.
Forsothe Isaac sowide in that lond, and he foond an hundrid fold in that yeer; and the Lord blesside hym.
And the man was maad riche, and he yede profitynge and encreessynge til he was maad ful greet.
Also he hadde possessioun of scheep and grete beestis, and ful myche of meyne. For this thing Palestyns hadden enuye to hym,
and thei stoppiden in that tyme and filliden with erthe alle the pittis whiche the seruauntis of Abraham his fadir hadden diggid,
in so myche that Abymelech him silf seide to Ysaac, Go thou awei fro vs, for thou art maad greetly myytier than we.
And he yede awei, that he schulde come to the stronde of Gerare, and dwelle there.
And he diggide eft other pittis, whiche the seruauntis of Abraham his fadir hadden diggid, and whiche the Filisteis hadden stoppid sumtyme, whanne Abraham was deed; and he clepide tho pittis bi the same names, bi whiche his fadir hadde clepid bifore.
Thei diggiden in the stronde, and thei founden wellynge watir.
But also strijf of scheepherdis of Gerare was there ayens the scheepherdis of Isaac, and thei seiden, The watir is oure; wherfor of that that bifelde he clepide the name of the pit fals chaleng.
And thei diggiden anothir, and thei stryueden also for that, and Ysaac clepide that pit enemytes.
And he yede forth fro thennus, and diggide another pit, for which thei stryueden not, therfor he clepid the name of that pit largenesse; and seide, Now God hath alargid vs, and hath maad to encreesse on erthe.
Forsothe he stiede fro that place in to Bersabee,
where the Lord God apperide to him in that nyyt; and seide, Y am God of Abraham, thi fadir; nyle thou drede, for Y am with thee, and Y schal blesse thee, and Y schal multiplie thi seed for my seruaunt Abraham.
And so Ysaac bildide ther an auter to the Lord; and whanne the name of the Lord was inwardli clepid, he stretchide forth a tabernacle; and he comaundide hise seruauntis that thei schulden digge pittis.
And whanne Abymelech, and Ochosat, hise frendis, and Ficol, duk of knyytis, hadden come fro Geraris to that place,
Isaac spak to hem, What camen ye to me, a man whom ye hatiden, and puttiden awei fro you?
Whiche answeriden, We seiyen that God is with thee, and therfor we seiden now, An ooth be bitwixe vs, and make we a couenaunt of pees,
that thou do not ony yuel to vs, as we touchiden `not ony thing of thine, nethir diden that that hirtide thee, but with pees we leften thee encressid bi the blessyng of the Lord.
Therfor Isaac made a feeste to hem; and after mete and drynk thei risen eerli,
and sworen ech to other; and Isaac lefte hem peisibli in to her place.
Lo! forsothe in that dai the seruauntis of Ysaac camen, tellynge to him of the pit which thei hadden diggid, and seiden, We han foundun watir.
Wherfor Ysaac clepide that pit abundaunce; and the name of the citee was set Bersabee til in to present dai.
Esau forsothe fourti yeer eld weddide twei wyues, Judith, the douytir of Beeri Ethei, and Bethsamath, the douyter of Elon, of the same place;
whiche bothe offendiden the soule of Isaac and of Rebecca.
Forsothe Isaac wexe eld, and hise iyen dasewiden, and he miyte not se. And he clepide Esau, his more sone, and seide to hym, My sone! Which answerde, Y am present.
To whom the fadir seide, Thou seest that Y haue woxun eld, and Y knowe not the dai of my deeth.
Take thin armeres, `arewe caas, and a bowe, and go out; and whanne thou hast take ony thing bi huntyng,
make to me a seew therof, as thou knowist that Y wole, and brynge that Y ete, and my soule blesse thee bifore that Y die.
And whanne Rebecca hadde herd this thing, and he hadde go in to the feeld to fille the comaundment of the fadir,
sche seide to hir sone Jacob, Y herde thi fadir spekynge with Esau, thi brothir, and seiynge to him, Brynge thou me of thin huntyng,
and make thow metis, that Y ete, and that Y blesse thee bifor the Lord bifor that Y die.
Now therfor, my sone, assent to my counsels,
and go to the floc, and brynge to me tweyne the beste kidis, that Y make metis of tho to thi fadir, whiche he etith gladli;
and that whanne thow hast brouyt in tho metis, and he hath ete, he blesse thee bifore that he die.
To whom Jacob answerde, Thou knowist that Esau my brother is an heeri man, and Y am smethe; if my fadir `touchith and feelith me,
Y drede lest he gesse that Y wolde scorne him, and lest he brynge in cursyng on me for blessyng.
To whom the modir seide, My sone, this cursyng be in me; oonly here thou my vois, and go, and brynge that that Y seide.
He yede, and brouyte, and yaf to his modir. Sche made redi metis, as sche knewe that his fadir wolde,
and sche clothide Jacob in ful goode clothis of Esau, whiche sche hadde at home anentis hir silf.
And sche `compasside the hondis with litle skynnys of kiddis, and kyuerede the `nakide thingis of the necke;
and sche yaf seew, and bitook the loouys whiche sche hadde bake.
And whanne these weren brouyt in, he seide, My fadir! And he answerde, Y here; who art thou, my sone?
And Jacob seide, Y am Esau, thi first gendrid sone. Y haue do to thee as thou comaundist to me; rise thou, sitte, and ete of myn huntyng, that thi soule blesse me.
Eft Ysaac seide to his sone, My sone, hou miytist thou fynde so soone? Which answerde, It was Goddis wille, that this that Y wolde schulde come soone to me.
And Isaac seide, My sone, come thou hidir, that Y touche thee, and that Y preue wher thou art my sone Esau, ethir nay.
He neiyede to the fadir; and whanne he hadde feelid hym, Isaac seide, Sotheli the vois is the vois of Jacob, but the hondis ben the hondis of Esau.
And Isaac knew not Jacob, for the heery hondis expressiden the licnesse of the more sone.
Therfor Isaac blesside him, and seide, Art thou my sone Esau? Jacob answerde, Y am.
And Isaac seide, My sone, brynge thou to me metis of thin huntyng, that my soule blesse thee. And whanne Isaac hadde ete these metis brouyt, Jacob brouyte also wyn to Isaac, and whanne this was drunkun,
Isaac seide to him, My sone, come thou hidir, and yyue to me a cos.
Jacob neiyede, and kisside hym; and anoon as Isaac feelide the odour of hise clothis, he blesside him, and seide, Lo! the odour of my sone as the odour of a `feeld ful which the Lord hath blessid.
God yyue to thee of the dewe of heuene, and of the fatnesse of erthe, aboundaunce of whete, and of wyn, and of oile;
and puplis serue thee, and lynagis worschipe thee; be thou lord of thi britheren, and the sones of thi modir be bowid bifor thee; be he cursid that cursith thee, and he that blessith thee, be fillid with blessyngis.
Vnnethis Isaac hadde fillid the word, and whanne Jacob was gon out,
Esau cam, and brouyte in metis sodun of the huntyng to the fadir, and seide, My fadir, rise thou, and ete of the huntyng of thi sone, that thi soule blesse me.
And Isaac seide, Who forsothe art thou? Which answerde, Y am Esau, thi firste gendrid sone.
Isaac dredde bi a greet astonying; and he wondride more, than it mai be bileued, and seide, Who therfor is he which a while ago brouyte to me huntyng takun, and Y eet of alle thingis bifor that thou camest; and Y blesside him? and he schal be blessid.
Whanne the wordis of the fadir weren herd, Esau rorid with a greet cry, and was astonyed, and seide, My fadir, blesse thou also me.
Which seide, Thy brother cam prudentli, and took thi blessyng.
And Esau addide, Justli his name is clepid Jacob, for lo! he supplauntide me another tyme; bifor he took awei `my firste gendride thingis, and now the secounde tyme he rauyschide priueli my blessyng. And eft he seide to the fadir, Wher thou hast not reserued a blessyng also to me?
Ysaac answeride, Y haue maad him thi lord, and Y haue maad suget alle hise britheren to his seruage; Y haue stablischid him in whete, and wyn, and oile; and, my sone, what schal Y do to thee aftir these thingis?
To whom Esau saide, Fadir, wher thou hast oneli o blessyng? Y biseche that also thou blesse me. And whanne Esau wepte with greet yellyng,
Isaac was stirid, and seide to hym, Thi blessyng schal be in the fatnesse of erthe, and in the dew of heuene fro aboue;
thou schalt lyue bi swerd, and thou schalt serue thi brothir, and tyme schal come whanne thou schalt shake awei, and vnbynde his yok fro thi nollis.
Therfor Esau hatide euer Jacob for the blessyng bi which the fadir hadde blessid hym; and Esau seide in his herte, The daies of morenyng of my fadir schulen come, and Y schal sle Jacob, my brothir.
These thingis weren teld to Rebecca, and sche sente, and clepide hir sone Jacob, and seide to hym, Lo! Esau, thi brothir, manaasith to sle thee;
now therfor, my sone, here thou my vois, and rise thou, and fle to Laban, my brother, in Aran;
and thou schalt dwelle with hym a fewe daies, til the woodnesse of thi brother reste,
and his indignacioun ceesse, and til he foryite tho thingis whiche thou hast don ayens hym. Aftirward Y schal sende, and Y schal brynge thee fro thennus hidir. Whi schal Y be maad soneles of euer eithir sone in o dai?
And Rebecca seide to Isaac, It anoieth me of my lijf for the douytris of Heth; if Jacob takith a wijf of the kynrede of this lond, Y nyle lyue.
And so Isaac clepide Jacob, and blesside hym, and comaundide to hym, and seide, Nyle thou take a wijf of the kyn of Canaan; but go thou,
and walke forth in to Mesopotanye of Sirie, to the hows of Batuel, fadir of thi modir, and take to thee of thennus a wijf of the douytris of Laban, thin vncle.
Sotheli Almyyti God blesse thee, and make thee to encreesse, and multiplie thee, that thou be in to cumpanyes of puplis;
and God yyue to thee the blessyngis of Abraham, and to thi seed aftir thee, that thou welde the lond of thi pilgrymage, which he bihiyte to thi grauntsir.
And whanne Ysaac hadde left hym, he yede forth, and cam in to Mesopotanye of Sirie, to Laban, the sone of Batuel of Sirie, the brother of Rebecca, his modir.
Forsothe Esau seiy that his fadir hadde blessid Jacob, and hadde sent him in to Mesopotanye of Sirie, that he schulde wedde a wijf of thennus, and that aftir the blessyng he comaundide to Jacob, and seide, Thou schalt not take a wijf of the douytris of Canaan;
and that Jacob obeiede to his fadir `and modir, and yede in to Sirie;
also Esau preuyde that his fadir bihelde not gladli the douytris of Canaan.
And he yede to Ismael, and weddide a wijf, with out these whiche he hadde bifore, Melech, the douyter of Ismael, sone of Abraham, the sistir of Nabaioth.
Therfor Jacob yede out of Bersabee, and yede to Aran.
And whanne he hadde come to sum place, and wolde reste ther inne aftir the goynge doun of the sunne, he took of the stoonus that laien ther, and he puttide vndur his heed, and slepte in the same place.
And he seiye in sleep a laddir stondynge on the erthe, and the cop ther of touchinge heuene; and he seiy Goddis aungels stiynge vp and goynge doun ther bi,
and the Lord fastned to the laddir, seiynge to hym, Y am the Lord God of Abraham, thi fadir, and God of Isaac; Y schal yyue to thee and to thi seed the lond in which thou slepist.
And thi seed schal be as the dust of erthe, thou schalt be alargid to the eest, and west, and north, and south; and alle lynagis of erthe schulen be blessid in thee and in thi seed.
And Y schal be thi kepere, whidur euer thou schalt go; and Y schal lede thee ayen in to this lond, and Y schal not leeue no but Y schal fil alle thingis whiche Y seide.
And whanne Jacob hadde wakyd of sleep, he seide, Verili the Lord is in this place, and Y wiste not.
And he seide dredynge, Hou worschipful is this place! Here is noon other thing no but the hows of God, and the yate of heuene.
Therfor Jacob roos eerli, and took the stoon which he hadde put vndur his heed, and reiside in to a title, and helde oile aboue.
And he clepide the name of that citee Bethel, which was clepid Lusa bifore.
Also he auowide a vow, and seide, If God is with me, and kepith me in the weie in which Y go, and yyueth to me looues to ete, and clothis to be clothid,
and Y turne ayen in prosperite to the hows of my fadir, the Lord schal be in to God to me.
And this stoon, which Y reiside in to a title, schal be clepid the hows of God, and Y schal offre tithis to thee of alle thingis whiche thou schalt yyue to me.
Therfor Jacob passide forth, and cam in to the eest lond;
and seiy a pit in the feeld, and thre flockis of scheep restynge bisidis it, for whi scheep weren watrid therof, and the mouth therof was closid with a greet stoon.
And the custom was that whanne alle scheep weren gaderid togidere, thei schulden turne awei the stoon, and whanne the flockis weren fillid thei schulden put it eft on the mouth of the pit.
And Jacob seide to the scheepherdis, Brithren, of whennus ben ye? Whiche answeriden, Of Aran.
And he axide hem and seide, Wher ye knowen Laban, the sone of Nachor? Thei seiden, We knowen.
Jacob seide, Is he hool? Thei seiden, He is in good staat; and lo! Rachel, his douytir, cometh with his flok.
And Jacob seide, Yit myche of the dai is to come, and it is not tyme that the flockis be led ayen to the fooldis; sotheli yyue ye drynk to the scheep, and so lede ye hem ayen to mete.
Whiche answeriden, We moun not til alle scheep be gederid to gidere, and til we remouen the stoon fro the mouth of the pit to watir the flockis.
Yit thei spaken, and lo! Rachel cam with the scheep of hir fadir.
And whanne Jacob seiy hir, and knewe the douytir of his modris brothir, and the scheep of Laban his vncle, he remeuyde the stoon with which the pit was closid;
and whanne the flok was watrid, he kisside hir, and he wepte with `vois reisid.
And he schewide to hir that he was the brothir of hir fadir, and the sone of Rebecca; and sche hastide, and telde to hir fadir.
And whanne he hadde herd, that Jacob, the sone of his sistir, cam, he ran ayens hym, and he biclippide Jacob and kisside hym, and ledde in to his hows. Forsothe whanne the causis of the iurney weren herd,
Laban answeride, Thou art my boon and my fleisch. And aftir that the daies of o moneth weren fillid, Laban seide to him,
`Whethir for thou art my brothir, thou schalt serue me frely? seie thou what mede thou schalt take.
Forsothe Laban hadde twei douytris, the name of the more was Lya, sotheli the lesse was clepid Rachel;
but Lya was blere iyed, Rachel was of fair face, and semeli in siyt.
And Jacob louede Rachel, and seide, Y schal serue thee seuene yeer for Rachel thi lesse douytir.
Laban answeride, It is betere that Y yyue hir to thee than to anothir man; dwelle thou at me.
Therfor Jacob seruyde seuene yeer for Rachel; and the daies semyden fewe to hym for the greetnesse of loue.
And he seide to Laban, Yyue thou my wijf to me, for the tyme is fillid that Y entre to hir.
And whanne many cumpenyes of freendis weren clepid to the feeste, he made weddyngis,
and in the euentid Laban brouyte in to hym Lya his douytir,
and yaf an handmaide, Selfa bi name, to the douyter. And whanne Jacob hadde entrid to hir bi custom, whanne the morewtid was maad, he seiy Lya,
and seide to his wyues fadir, What is it that thou woldist do? wher Y seruede not thee for Rachel? whi hast thou disseyued me?
Laban answerde, It is not custom in oure place that we yyue first the `lesse douytris to weddyngis;
fille thou the wouke of daies of this couplyng, and Y schal yyue to thee also this Rachel, for the werk in which thou schalt serue me bi othere seuene yeer.
Jacob assentide to the couenaunt, and whanne the wouke was passid,
he weddide Rachel, to whom the fadir hadde youe Bala seruauntesse.
And at the laste he vside the weddyngis desirid, and settide the loue of the `wijf suynge bifore the former; and he seruede at Laban seuene othere yeer.
Forsothe the Lord seiy that he dispiside Lya, and openyde hir wombe while the sistir dwellide bareyn.
And Lia childide a sone conseyued, and clepide his name Ruben, and seide, The Lord seiy my mekenesse; now myn hosebonde schal loue me.
And eft sche conseyuede, `and childide a sone, and seide, For the Lord seiy that Y was dispisid, he yaf also this sone to me; and sche clepide his name Symeon.
And sche conseyuede the thridde tyme, and childide anothir sone, and she seide also, Now myn hosebonde schal be couplid to me, for Y childide thre sones to him; and therfor sche clepide his name Leuy.
The fourthe tyme sche conseyuede, and childide a sone, and seide, Now I schal knouleche to the Lord; and herfor she clepide his name Judas; and ceesside to childe.
Forsothe Rachel seiy, that sche was vnfruytful, and hadde enuye to the sister, and seide to hir hosebonde, Yyue thou fre children to me, ellis Y schal die.
To whom Jacob was wrooth, and answerde, Wher Y am for God, which haue priued thee fro the fruyt of thi wombe?
And sche seide, Y haue `a seruauntesse Bala, entre thou to hir that she childe on my knees, and that Y haue sones of hir.
And sche yaf to hym Bala in to matrimony;
and whanne the hosebonde hadde entrid to hir, sche conseyuede, and childide a sone.
And Rachel seide, the Lord demede to me, and herde my preier, and yaf a sone to me; and therfor sche clepide his name Dan.
And eft Bala conseyuede, and childide anothir sone,
for whom Rachel seide, The Lord hath maad me lijk to my sistir, and Y wexide strong; and sche clepide hym Neptalym.
Lya feelide that sche ceesside to bere child, and sche yaf Selfa, hir handmayde, to the hosebonde.
And whanne Selfa aftir conseyuyng childide a sone, Lya seide, Blessidly;
and therfor sche clepide his name Gad.
Also Selfa childide anothir sone,
and Lia seide, This is for my blis, for alle wymmen schulen seie me blessid; therfor sche clepide hym Aser.
Forsothe Ruben yede out in to the feeld in the tyme of wheete heruest, and foond mandragis, whiche he brouyte to Lya, his modir. And Rachel seide, Yyue thou to me a part of the mandragis of thi sone.
Lya answeride, Whether it semeth litil to thee, that thou hast rauyschid the hosebonde fro me, no but thou take also the mandragis of my sone? Rachel seide, The hosebonde sleepe with thee in this nyyt for the mandragis of thi sone.
And whanne Jacob cam ayen fro the feeld at euentid, Lya yede out in to his comyng, and seide, Thou shalt entre to me, for Y haue hired thee with hire for the mandragis of my sone. He slepte with hir in that nyyt;
and God herde hir preiers, and sche conseyuede, and childide the fyuethe sone;
and seide, God yaf meede to me, for Y yaf myn handmayde to myn hosebond; and sche clepide his name Isacar.
Eft Lia conseyuede, and childide the sixte sone,
and seide, The Lord hath maad me riche with a good dower, also in this tyme myn hosebonde schal be with me, for Y childide sixe sones to hym; and therfore sche clepide his name Sabulon.
Aftir whom sche childide a douyter, Dyna bi name.
Also the Lord hadde mynde on Rachel, and herde hir, and openyde hir wombe.
And sche conseyuede, and childide a sone, and seide, God hath take a wey my schenschipe; and sche clepid his name Joseph,
and seide, The Lord yyue to me another sone.
Sotheli whanne Joseph was borun, Jacob seide to his wyues fadir, Delyuere thou me, that Y turne ayen in to my cuntrey and to my lond.
Yyue thou to me my wyues and fre children for whiche Y seruede thee, that Y go; forsothe thou knowist the seruyce bi which Y seruede thee.
Laban seide to hym, Fynde Y grace in thi siyt, Y haue lerned bi experience that God blesside me for thee;
ordeyne thou the meede which Y schal yyue to thee.
And he answeride, Thou woost hou Y seruede thee, and hou greet thi possessioun was in myn hondis;
thou haddist litil bifore that Y cam to thee, and now thou art maad riche, and the Lord blesside thee at myn entryng; therfor it is iust that Y purueye sum tyme also to myn hows.
And Laban seide, What schal Y yyue to thee? And Jacob seide, Y wole no thing but if thou doist that that Y axe, eft Y schal fede and kepe thi scheep.
Cumpasse thou alle thi flockis, and departe thou alle diuerse scheep and of spottid flees, and what euer thing schal be dun, and spottid, and dyuerse, as wel in scheep as in geet, it schal be my mede.
And my riytfulnesse schal answere to me to morewe, whanne the tyme of couenaunt schal come bifor thee; and alle that ben not dyuerse and spottid and dunne, as well in sheep as in geet, schulen repreue me of thefte.
And Laban seide, Y haue acceptable that that thou axist.
And he departide in that dai the geet, and scheep, geet buckis, and rammes, dyuerse and spottid. Sothely he bitook al the flok of o coloure, that is, of white and of blak flees in the hond of hise sones;
and he settide the space of weie of thre daies bitwixe hise sones and the hosebonde of hise douytris, that fedde othere flockis' of hym.
Therfor Jacob took greene yerdis of popeleris, and of almoundis, and of planes, and in parti dide awei the rynde of tho, and whanne the ryndis weren `drawun a wei, whitnesse apperide in these that weren maad bare; sothely tho that weren hoole dwelliden grene, and bi this maner the coloure was maad dyuerse.
And Jacob puttide tho yerdis in the trowis, where the watir was held out, that whanne the flockis schulden come to drynke, thei schulden haue the yerdis bifor the iyen, and schulden conseyue in the siyt of the yerdis.
And it was doon that in thilke heete of riding the sheep schulde biholde the yerdis, and that thei schulden brynge forth spotti beestis, and dyuerse, and bispreynt with dyuerse colour.
And Jacob departide the floc, and puttide the yerdis in the trowis bifor the iyen of the rammys. Sotheli alle the white and blake weren Labans; sotheli the othere weren Jacobis; for the flockis weren departid bytwixe hem silf.
Therfor whanne the scheep weren ridun in the firste tyme, Jacob puttide the yerdis in the `trouyis of watir bifor the iyen of rammys and of scheep, that thei schulden conseyue in the siyt of tho yerdis.
Forsothe whanne the late medlyng and the laste conseyuyng weren, Jacob puttide not tho yerdis; and tho that weren late, weren maad Labans, and tho that weren of the firste tyme weren Jacobis.
And he was maad ful riche, and hadde many flockis, handmaydis, and seruauntis, camels, and assis.
Aftir that Jacob herde the wordis of the sones of Laban, that seiden, Jacob hath take awei alle thingis that weren oure fadris, and of his catel Jacob is maad riche, and noble.
Also Jacob perseyuede the face of Laban, that it was not ayens hym as yistirdai, and the thridde dai agoon,
moost for the Lord seide to hym, Turne ayen into the lond of thi fadris, and to thi generacioun, and Y shal be with thee.
He sente, and clepide Rachel, and Lya, in to the feeld, where he kepte flockis, and he seide to hem,
Y se the face of youre fadir, that it is not ayens me as `yisterdai and the thridde dai agoon; but God of my fadir was with me.
And ye witen that with alle my strengthis Y seruede youre fadir;
but and youre fadir disseyuyde me, and chaungide my meede ten sithis; and netheles God suffride not hym to anoye me.
If he seide ony tyme, Dyuerse colourid sheep schulen be thi medis, alle sheep brouyten forth dyuerse colourid lambren; forsothe whanne he seide ayenward, Thou shalte take alle white for mede, alle the flockis brouyten forth white beestis;
and God took a wey the substaunce of youre fadir, and yaf to me.
For aftir that the tyme of conseyuyng of sheep cam, Y reiside myn iyen, and seiy in sleep malis dyuerse, and spotti, and of dyuerse colouris, stiynge on femalis.
And the aungel of the Lord seide to me in sleep, Jacob! and Y answeride, Y am redy.
Which seide, Reise thin iyen, and se alle malis dyuerse, byspreynt, and spotti, stiynge on femalis; for Y seiy alle thingis whiche Laban dide to thee;
Y am God of Bethel, where thou anoyntidist a stoon, and madist auow to me. Now therefor rise thou, and go out of this lond, and turne ayen in to the lond of thi birthe.
And Rachel and Lya answeriden, Wher we han ony thing residue in the catels, and eritage of oure fadir?
Wher he `arettide not vs as aliens, and selde, and eet oure prijs?
But God took awei the richessis of oure fadir, and yaf tho to vs, and to oure sones; wherfor do thou alle thingis whiche God hath comaundide to thee.
Forsothe Jacob roos, and puttide hise fre children and wyues on camels, and yede forth;
and he took al his catel, flockis, and what euer thing he hadde gete in Mesopotanye, and yede to Isaac, his fadir, into the lond of Canaan.
In that tyme Laban yede to schere scheep, and Rachel stal the idols of hir fadir.
And Jacob nolde knouleche to the fadir of his wijf, that he wolde fle;
and whanne he hadde go, as wel he as alle thingis that weren of his riyt, and whanne he hadde passid the water, and he yede ayens the hil of Galaad,
it was teld to Laban, in the thridde dai, that Jacob fledde.
And Laban took his britheren, and pursuede hym seuene daies, and took hym in the hil of Galaad.
And Laban seiy in sleep the Lord seiynge to him, Be war that thou speke not ony thing sharpli ayens Jacob.
And thanne Jacob hadde stretchid forth the tabernacle in the hil; and whanne he hadde sued Jacob with his britheren, `he settide tente in the same hil of Galaad; and he seide to Jacob,
Whi hast thou do so, that the while I wiste not thou woldist dryue awey my douytris as caitifs by swerd?
Whi woldist thou fle the while Y wiste not, nether woldist shewe to me, that Y shulde sue thee with ioie, and songis, and tympans, and harpis?
Thou suffridist not that Y schulde kisse my sones and douytris; thou hast wrouyt folili.
And now sotheli myn hond mai yelde yuel to thee, but the God of thi fadir seide to me yisterdai, Be war that thou speke not ony harder thing with Jacob.
Suppose, if thou coueitedist to go to thi kynesmen, and the hows of thi fadir was in desir to thee, whi hast thou stole my goddis?
Jacob answeride, That Y yede forth while thou wistist not, Y dredde lest thou woldist take awey thi douytris violentli;
sotheli that thou repreuest me of thefte, at whom euer thou fyndist thi goddis, be he slayn bifor oure britheren; seke thou, what euer thing of thine thou fyndist at me, and take awei. Jacob seide these thingis, and wiste not that Rachel stal the idols.
And so Laban entride into the tabernacle of Jacob, and of Lya, and of euer eithir meyne, and foond not; and whanne Laban hadde entrid in to the tente of Rachel,
sche hastide, and hidde the idols vndur the strewyngis of the camel, and sat aboue. And sche seide to Laban, sekynge al the tente and fyndynge no thing,
My lord, be not wrooth that Y may not rise bifore thee, for it bifelde now to me bi the custom of wymmen; so the bisynesse of the sekere was scorned.
And Jacob bolnyde, and seide with strijf, For what cause of me, and for what synne of me, hast thou come so fersly aftir me,
and hast souyt al `the portenaunce of myn hous? What `hast thou founde of al the catel of thin hows? Putte thou here bifore my britheren and thi britheren, and deme thei betwixe me and thee.
Was I with thee herfore twenti yeer? Thi sheep and geet weren not bareyn, Y eet not the rammes of thi flok,
nether Y schewide to thee ony thing takun of a beeste; Y yeldide al harm; what euer thing perischide bi thefte, thou axidist of me;
Y was angwischid in dai and nyyt with heete and frost, and sleep fledde fro myn iyen;
so Y seruede thee bi twenti yeer in thin hows, fourtene yeer for thi douytris, and sixe yeer for thi flockis; and thou chaungidist my mede ten sithis.
If God of my fadir Abraham, and the drede of Isaac hadde not helpid me, perauenture now thou haddist left me nakid; the Lord bihelde my turmentyng and the traueyl of myn hondis, and repreuyde thee yistirdai.
Laban answeride hym, The douytris, and thi sones, and flockis, and alle thingis whiche thou seest, ben myne, what mai Y do to my sones, and to the sones of sones?
Therfor come thou, and make we boond of pees, that it be witnessyng bitwixe me, and thee.
And so Jacob took a stoon, and reiside it in to a signe, and seide to hise britheren,
Brynge ye stoonus; whiche gadriden, and maden an heep, and eten on it.
And Laban clepide it the heep of wittnesse, and Jacob clepide it the heep of witnessyng; euer eithir clepide bi the proprete of his langage.
And Laban seide, This heep schal be witnesse bytwixe me and thee to day, and herfor the name therof was clepid Galaad, that is, the heep of witnesse.
And Laban addide, The Lord biholde, and deme bitwixe vs, whanne we schulen go awei fro yow;
if thou schalt turmente my douytris, and if thou schal brynge yn othere wyues on hem, noon is witnesse of oure word, outakun God, whiche is present, and biholdith.
And eft he seide to Jacob, Lo! this heep, and stoon, whiche Y reiside bitwixe me and thee, schal be witnesse;
sotheli this heep, and stoon be in to witnessyng, forsothe if Y schal passe it, and go to thee, ether thou shalt passe, and thenke yuel to me.
God of Abraham, and God of Nachor, God of the fadir of hem, deme bitwixe vs. Therfor Jacob swoor by the drede of his fadir Ysaac;
and whanne slayn sacrifices weren offrid in the hil, he clepyde his britheren to ete breed, and whanne thei hadden ete, thei dwelliden there.
Forsothe Laban roos bi nyyt, and kisside his sones, and douytris, and blesside hem, and turnede ayen in to his place.
Forsothe Jacob wente forth in the weie in which he began, and the aungels of the Lord metten him.
And whanne he hadde seyn hem, he seide, These ben the castels of God; and he clepide the name of that place Manaym, that is, castels.
Sotheli Jacob sente bifore him also messangeris to Esau, his brother, in to the lond of Seir, in the cuntrey of Edom;
and comaundide to hem, and seide, Thus speke ye to my lord Esau, Thi brothir Jacob seith these thingis, Y was a pilgrym at Laban, `and Y was `til in to present dai;
Y haue oxun, and assis, and scheep, and seruauntis, and hand maydis, and Y sende now a message to my lord, that Y fynde grace in thi siyt.
And the messageris turneden ayen to Jacob, and seiden, We camen to Esau, thi brother, and lo! he hastith in to thi comyng, with foure hundrid men.
Jacob dredde greetli, and he was aferd, and departide the puple that was with hym, and he departide the flockis, and scheep, and oxun, and camels, in to twei cumpenyes;
and seide, If Esau schal come to o cumpeny, and schal smyte it, the tothir cumpeny which is residue schal be saued.
And Jacob seide, A! God of my fadir Abraham, and God of my fadir Isaac, A! Lord, that seidist to me, Turne thou ayen in to thi lond, and in to the place of thi birthe, and Y schal do wel to thee,
Y am lesse than alle thi merciful doyngis, and than thi treuthe which thou hast fillid to thi seruaunt; with my staf Y passide this Jordan, and now Y go ayen with twei cumpanyes;
delyuere thou me fro the hond of my brothir Esau, for Y drede him greetli, lest he come and sle the modris with the sones.
Thou spakist that thou schuldist do wel to me, and shuldist alarge my seed as the grauel of the see, that mai not be noumbrid for mychilnesse.
And whanne Jacob hadde slept there in that nyyt, he departide of tho thingis whiche he hadde yiftis to Esau, his brothir,
two hundrid geet, and twenti buckis of geet, two hundrid scheep, and twenti rammys,
camels fulle with her foolis thretti, fourti kyen, and twenti boolis, twenti sche assis, and ten foolis of hem.
And he sente bi the hondis of his seruauntis alle flockis bi hem silf; and he seide to hise children, Go ye bifore me, and a space be betwixe flok and flok.
And he comaundide to the formere, and seide, If thou schalt mete my brothir Esau, and he schal axe thee, whos man thou art, ether whidir thou goist, ether whos ben these thingis whiche thou suest,
thou schalt answere, Of thi seruaunt Jacob, he hath sent yiftis to his lord Esau, and he cometh aftir vs.
In lijk maner, he yaf comaundementis to the secounde, and to the thridde, and to alle that sueden flockis; and seide, Speke ye bi the same wordis to Esau,
whanne ye fynden hym, and ye schulen adde, Also Jacob hym silf thi seruaunt sueth oure weie. For Jacob seide, Y schal plese Esau with yiftis that goon bifore, and aftirward Y schal se hym; in hap he schal be mercyful to me.
And so the yiftis yeden bifore hym; sotheli he dwellide in that nyyt in the tentis.
And whanne Jacob hadde arise auysseli, he took hise twei wyues, and so many seruauntessis with enleuen sones, and passide the forthe of Jaboth.
And whanne alle thingis that perteyneden to hym weren led ouer, he dwellide aloone, and, lo!
a man wrastlide with him til to the morwetid.
And whanne the man seiy that he miyte not ouercome Jacob, he touchide the senewe of Jacobis hipe, and it driede anoon.
And he seide to Jacob, Leeue thou me, for the morewtid stieth now. Jacob answeride, Y schal not leeue thee, no but thou blesse me.
Therfore he seide, What name is to thee? He answeride, Jacob.
And the man seide, Thi name schal no more be clepid Jacob, but Israel; for if thou were strong ayens God, hou miche more schalt thou haue power ayens men.
Jacob axide him, Seie thou to me bi what name thou art clepid? He answerde, Whi axist thou my name, whiche is wondirful? And he blesside Jacob in the same place.
And Jacob clepide the name of that place Fanuel, and seide, Y siy the Lord face to face, and my lijf is maad saaf.
And anoon the sunne roos to hym, aftir that he passide Fanuel; forsothe he haltide in the foot.
For which cause the sones of Israel eten not `til in to present day the senewe, that driede in the hipe of Jacob; for the man touchide the senewe of Jacobs hipe, and it driede.
Forsothe Jacob reiside hise iyen, and seiy Esau comynge, and foure hundrid men with hym; and he departide the sones of Lia, and of Rachel, and of bothe seruauntessis.
And he puttide euer either handmaide, and the fre children of hem, in the bigynnyng; sotheli he puttide Lia, and her sones, in the secounde place; forsothe he puttide Rachel and Joseph the laste.
And Jacob yede bifore, and worschipide lowli to erthe seuensithis, til his brothir neiyede.
And so Esau ran ayens his brothir, and collide hym, and Esau helde his necke, and kisside, and wepte.
And whanne the iyen weren reisid, he seiy the wymmen, and the litle children of hem, and seide, What wolen these to hem silf? and wher thei pertenen to thee? Jacob answeride, Thei ben the litle children, whiche God hath youe to me, thi seruaunt.
And the handmaydis and her sones neiyeden, and weren bowid.
Also Lya neiyede with hir fre children; and whanne thei hadden worschipid in lijk maner, Joseph and Rachel the laste worschipeden.
And Esau seide, What ben these cumpanyes, whiche Y mette? Jacob answerde, That Y schulde fynde grace bifore my lord.
And he seide, My brother, Y haue ful many thingis, thi thingis be to thee.
And Jacob seide, Y biseche, nyle thou so, but if Y foond grace in thin iyen, take thou a litil yifte of myn hondis; for Y seiy so thi face as I seiy the cheer of God;
be thou merciful to me, and resseyue the blessyng which Y brouyte to thee, and which blessyng God yyuynge alle thingis yaf to me. Vnnethis, while the brothir compellide,
he resseyuede, and seide, Go we to gidere, and Y schal be felowe of thi weie.
And Jacob seide, My lord, thou knowist that Y haue litle children tendre, and scheep, and kien with calue with me, and if Y schal make hem for to trauele more in goynge, alle the flockis schulen die in o dai;
my lord go bifore his seruaunt, and Y schal sue litil and litil hise steppis, as I shal se that my litle children mown, til Y come to my lord, in to Seir.
Esau answeride, Y preie thee, that of the puple which is with me, nameli felowis of thi weie dwelle. Jacob seide, It is no nede; Y haue nede to this o thing oneli, that Y fynde grace in thi siyt, my lord.
And so Esau turnede ayen in that dai in the weie bi which he cam, in to Seir.
And Jacob cam in to Sochot, where whanne he hadde bildid an hows, and hadde set tentis, he clepide the name of that place Sochot, that is, tabernaclis.
And Jacob passide in to Salem, a citee of Sichimis, whiche is in the lond of Canaan, aftir that he turnede ayen fro Mesopotanye of Sirie, and he dwellide besidis the citee.
And he bouyte for an hundrid lambren a part of the feeld, in which he settide tabernaclis, of the sones of Emor, fadir of Sichem.
And whanne he hadde reisid an auter there, he inwardly clepide on it the strongeste God of Israel.
Forsothe Dyna, the douytir of Lya, yede out to se the wymmen of that cuntrey.
And whanne Sichem, the sone of Emor Euey, the prince of that lond, hadde seyn hir, he louede hir, and rauyschide, and sclepte with hir, and oppresside the virgyn bi violence.
And his soule was boundun faste with hir, and he pleside hir sory with flateringis.
And he yede to Emor,
his fadir, and seide, Take to me this damysel a wijf. And whanne Jacob hadde herd this thing, while the sones weren absent, and ocupied in the fedyng of scheep, he was stille, til thei camen ayen.
Sotheli whanne Emor, the fadir of Sichem, was gon out, `that he schulde speke to Jacob, lo!
hise sones camen fro the feeld. And whanne this thing that bifelde was herd, thei weren wroothe greetli; for he wrouyte a foul thing in Israel, and he hadde do a thing vnleueful in the defoulyng of the douyter of Jacob.
And so Emor spak to hem, The soule of my sone Sichem cleuyde to youre douytir, yeue ye hir a wijf to hym,
and ioyne we weddyngis to gidere; yyue ye youre douytris to vs,
and take ye oure douytris, and dwelle ye with vs; the lond is in youre power, tile ye, make ye marchaundise, and welde ye it.
But also Sichem seide to the fadir and britheren of hir, Fynde Y grace bifor you, and what euer thingis ye ordeynen Y schal yyue;
encreesse ye the dower, and axe ye yiftis, Y schal yyue wilfull that that ye axen; oonli yyue ye this damysele a wijf to me.
The sones of Jacob answeriden in gile to Sichem and his fadir, and weren feerse for the defoulyng of maidenhod of the sistir,
We moun not do this that ye axen, nether we moun yyue oure sistir to a man vncircumcidid, which thing is vnleueful and abhomynable anentis vs.
But in this we schulen mowe be boundun in pees, if ye wole be lijk vs, and ech of male kynde be circumcidid in you,
thanne we schulen yyue and take togidre oure douytris and youre; and we schulen dwelle with you, and we schulen be o puple.
Forsothe if ye nylen be circumcidid, we schulen take oure douytir, and schulen go a wei.
The profryng of hem pleside Emor and Sichem,
his sone, and the yong wexynge man dilaiede not, that ne he fillide anoon that that was axid, for he louede the damysele greetli, and he was noble in al `the hous of his fadir.
And thei entriden in to the yate of the citee, and spaken to the puple,
These men ben pesible, and wolen dwelle with vs; make thei marchaundie in the loond, and tile thei it, which is large and brood, and hath nede to tileris; we schulen take her douytris to wyues, and we schulen yyue oure douytris to hem.
O thing is, for which so greet good is dilaied; if we circumciden oure malis, and suen the custom of the folc,
bothe her substaunce, and scheep, and alle thingis which thei welden, schulen be oure; oneli assente we in this, that we dwelle to gidere, and make o puple.
And alle men assentiden, and alle malis weren circumcidid.
And lo! in the thridde day, whanne the sorewe of woundis was moost greuous, twei sones of acob, Symeon and Leuy, britheren of Dyna, token swerdis, and entriden in to the citee booldeli; and whanne alle malis weren slayn,
thei killiden Emor and Sichem togidere, and token Dyna, her sistir, fro the hous of Sichem.
And whanne thei weren goon out, othere sones of Jacob felden in on the slayn men, and rifeliden the citee for the veniaunce of defoulyng of a virgyn.
And thei wastiden the scheep of tho men, and droues of oxun, and assis, and alle thingis that weren in howsis and feeldis,
and ledden prisoneris the litle children, and wyues of tho men.
And whanne these thingis weren don hardili, Jacob seide to Symeon and Leuy, Ye han troblid me, and han maad me hateful to Cananeis and Fereseis, dwellers of this lond; we ben fewe, thei schulen be gaderid to gidere and schulen sle me, and Y schal be don a wey and myn hous.
Symeon and Leuy answeriden, Whether thei ouyten mysuse oure sistir as an hoore?
Yn the mene tyme the Lord spak to Jacob, Ryse thou, and stie to Bethel, and dwelle thou there, and make thou an auter to the Lord, that apperide to thee whanne thou fleddist Esau, thi brother.
Forsothe Jacob seide, whanne al his hous was clepid to gidere, Caste ye a wei alien goddis, that ben `in the myddis of you, and be ye clensid, and chaunge ye youre clothis;
rise ye, and stie we into Bethel, that we make there an auter to the Lord, which herde me in the dai of my tribulacioun, and was felowe of my weie.
Therfor thei yauen to hym alle alien goddis which thei hadden, and eere ryngis, that weren in `the eeris of hem; and he deluyde tho vndur a `tre, clepid therubynte, which is bihynde the citee of Sichem.
And whanne thei yeden, drede assailide alle men by cumpas of the citee, and thei weren not hardi to pursue hem goynge a wei.

Forsothe Jacob dwellide in the lond of Canaan, in which his fadir was a pilgrym; and these weren the generaciouns of hym.
Joseph whanne he was of sixtene yeer, yit a child, kepte a flok with hise britheren, and was with the sones of Bala and Zelfa, wyues of his fadir; and he accuside his britheren at the fadir of `the worste synne.
Forsothe Israel louyde Joseph ouer alle hise sones, for he hadde gendrid hym in eelde; and he made to Joseph a cote of many colours.
Forsothe hise britheren sien that he was loued of the fader more than alle, and thei hatiden hym, and myyten not speke ony thing pesibli to hym.
And it bifelde that he telde to hise britheren a sweuene seyn, which cause was `the seed of more hatrede.
And Joseph seide to his britheren, Here ye the sweuene which Y seiy,
Y gesside that we bounden to gidere handfuls, and that as myn handful roos, and stood, and that youre handfuls stoden aboute and worschipiden myn handful.
Hise britheren answerden, Whether thou shalt be oure kyng, ethir we shulen be maad suget to thi lordschip? Therfor this cause of sweuenys and wordis mynystride the nurschyng of enuye, and of hatrede.
Also Joseph seiy another sweuene, which he telde to the britheren, and seide, Y seiy bi a sweuene that as the sunne, and moone, and enleuen sterris worschipiden me.
And whanne he hadde teld this sweuene to his fadir, and britheren, his fadir blamyde him, and seide, What wole this sweuene to it silf which thou hast seyn? Whether Y and thi modir, and thi britheren, schulen worschipe thee on erthe?
Therfor hise britheren hadden enuye to hym. Forsothe the fadir bihelde pryuely the thing,
and whanne his britheren dwelliden in Sichem, aboute flockis of the fadir `to be kept,
Israel seide to Joseph, Thi britheren kepen scheep in Sichymys; come thou, Y schal sende thee to hem.
And whanne Joseph answerde, Y am redi, Israel seide, Go thou, and se whether alle thingis ben esi anentis thi britheren, and scheep; and telle thou to me what is doon. He was sent fro the valey of Ebron, and cam into Sichem;
and a man foond hym errynge in the feeld, and `the man axide, what he souyte.
And he answerde, Y seke my britheren, schewe thou to me where thei kepten flockis.
And the man seide to hym, Thei yeden awei fro this place; forsothe Y herde hem seiynge, Go we into Dothaym. And Joseph yede aftir his britheren, and foond hem in Dothaym.
And whanne thei hadden seyn hym afer, bifor that he neiyede to hem,
thei thouyten to sle hym, and spaken to gidere, Lo! the dremere cometh, come ye,
sle we hym, and sende we into an eld sisterne, and we schulen seie, A wielde beeste ful wickid hath deuourid hym; and thanne it schal appere what hise dremes profiten to hym.
Sotheli Ruben herde this, and enforside to delyuere hym fro her hondis,
and seide, Sle we not the lijf of hym, nether schede we out his blood, but caste ye hym into an eeld cisterne, which is in the wildirnesse, and kepe ye youre hondis gilteles. Forsothe he seide this, willynge to delyuere hym fro her hondis, and to yelde to his fadir.
Therfor anoon as Joseph cam to hise britheren, thei dispuyliden hym of the coote, doun to the heele, and of many colours, and senten into the eeld cisterne,
that hadde no water.
And thei saten `to ete breed; and thei sien that Ismaelitis weigoers camen fro Galaad, and that her camels baren swete smellynge spiceries, and `rosyn, and stacten, into Egipt.
Therfor Judas seide to hise britheren, What schal it profite to vs, if we schulen sle oure brother, and schulen hide his blood?
It is betere that he be seeld to Ismalitis, and oure hondis be not defoulid, for he is oure brother and fleisch. The britheren assentiden to these wordis;
and whanne marchauntis of Madian passiden forth, thei drowen hym out of the cisterne, and seelden hym to Ismaelitis, for thriytti platis of siluer; whiche ledden hym in to Egipt.
And Ruben turnede ayen to the cisterne, and foond not the child;
and he to-rente his closis, and he yede to hise britheren, and seide, The child apperith not, and whidir schal Y go?
Forsothe thei token his coote, and dippiden in the blood of a kide, which thei hadden slayn; and senten men that baren to the fadir,
and seiden, We han founde this coote, se, whether it is the coote of thi sone, ether nai.
And whanne the fader hadde knowe it, he seide, It is the coote of my sone, a wielde beeste ful wickid hath ete hym, a beeste hath deuourid Joseph.
And he to-rente his clothis, and he was clothid with an heire, and biweilide his sone in myche tyme.
Sothely whanne hise fre children weren gaderid to gidere, that thei schulden peese the sorewe of the fadir, he nolde take counfort, but seide, Y schal go doun in to helle, and schal biweile my sone. And the while Jacob contynude in wepyng,
Madianytis seelden Joseph into Egipt to Putifar, chast `and onest seruaunt of Farao, maistir of the chyualrie.
Yn the same tyme Judas yede doun fro his britheren, and turnede to a man of Odolla, Hiram bi name;
and he siy ther a douytir of a man of Canaan, Sue bi name. And whanne he hadde takun hir to wijf,
he entride to hir, and sche conseyuede, and childide a sone, and clepide his name Her.
And eft whanne a child was conseyued, sche nemyde the child borun Onam.
And sche childide the thridde sone, whom sche clepide Cela, and whanne he was borun, sche ceesside to bere child more.
Forsothe Judas yaf a wijf, `Thamar bi name, to his firste gendrid sone Her.
And Her, the firste gendrid sone of Judas, was weiward in the siyt of the Lord, and therfor he was slayn of the Lord.
Therfor Judas seide to Onam, his sone, Entre thou to the wijf of thi brothir, and be thou felouschipid to hir, that thou reise seed to thi brothir.
And he wiste that sones schulden not be borun to him, `and he entride to the wijf of his brother, and schedde seed in to the erthe, lest the fre children schulden be borun bi the name of the brother;
and therfor the Lord smoot hym, for he dide abhomynable thing.
Wherfor Judas seide to Thamar, `wijf of his sone, Be thou widewe in the hous of thi fadir, til Sela my sone wexe, for he dredde lest also he schulde die as hise britheren. And sche yede, and dwellide in the hous of hir fadir.
Forsothe whanne many yeeris weren passid, the douyter of Sue, `the wijf of Juda, diede, and whanne coumfort was takun aftir morenyng, he stiede to the schereris of hise scheep, he and Iras of Odolla, that was kepere of the floc, stieden in to Thampnas.
And it was teld to Thamar, that `the fadir of hir hosebonde stiede to Thampnas, to schere scheep.
And sche dide awei the clothis of widewehod, and sche took a roket, and whanne the clothinge was chaungid, sche sat in the weilot that ledith to Tampna; for Sela hadde woxe, and sche hadde not take hym to hosebonde.
And whanne Judas hadde seyn hir, he supposide hir to be an hoore, for sche hadde hilid hir face, lest sche were knowun.
And Judas entride to hir, and seide, Suffre me that Y ligge with thee; for he wiste not that sche was the wijf of his sone. And whanne sche answeride, What schalt thou yyue to me, that thou ligge bi me?
he seide, Y schal sende to thee a kide of the flockis. And eft whanne sche seide, Y schal suffre that that thou wolt, if thou schalt yyue to me a wed, til thou sendist that that thou bihetist.
Judas seide, What wolt thou that be youun to thee for a wed? She answeride, Thi ryng, and thi bie of the arm, and the staaf which thou holdist in the hond. Therfor the womman conseyuide at o liggyng bi, and sche roos, and yede;
and whanne the clooth was `put awei which sche hadde take, sche was clothid in the clothis of widewhod.
Forsothe Judas sente a kide bi his scheepherde of Odolla, that he schulde resseyue the wed which he hadde youe to the womman; and whanne he hadde not founde hir,
he axide men of that place, Where is the womman that sat in the weie lot? And whanne alle men answeriden, An hoore was not in this place; he turnede ayen to Judas,
and seide to hym, Y foond not hir, but also men of that place seiden to me, that an hoore sat neuere there.
Judas seide, Haue sche to hir silf, certis sche may not repreue vs of a leesyng; Y sente the kyde which Y bihiyte, and thou foundist not hir.
Lo! sotheli aftir thre monethis thei telden to Judas, and seiden, Thamar, `wijf of thi sone, hath do fornycacioun, and hir womb semeth to wexe greet. Judas seide, Brynge ye hir forth, that sche be brent.
And whanne sche was led to peyne, sche sente to `the fadir of hir hosebonde, and seide, Y haue conseyued of the man, whose these thingis ben; knowe thou whose is the ryng, and bie of the arm, and staf?
And whanne the yiftis weren knowun, he seide, Sche is more iust than Y, for Y yaf not hir to Sela, my sone; netheles Judas knewe hir no more fleischli.
Sotheli whanne the childberyng neiyede, twei chyldren apperiden in the wombe, and in that birthe of children, oon brouyte forth the hond, in which the mydwijf boond a reed threed,
and seide, This schal go out `the formere.
Sotheli while he withdrowe the hond, the tother yede out, and the womman seide, Whi was the skyn in which the child lay in the wombe departid for thee? And for this cause sche clepide his name Fares.
Afterward his brothir yede out, in whos hond was the reed threed, whom sche clepide Zaram.
Therfor Joseph was led in to Egipt, and Putifar, `chast and onest seruaunt of Farao, prince of the oost, a man of Egipt, bouyte hym of the hondis of Ismaelitis, of which he was brouyt.
And the Lord was with hym, and he was a man doynge with prosperite in alle thingis. And Joseph dwellide in `the hows of his lord,
which knew best that the Lord was with Joseph, and that alle thingis whiche he dide, weren dressid of the Lord in `the hond of hym.
And Joseph foond grace bifor his lord, and `mynystride to hym, of whom Joseph was maad souereyn of alle thingis, and gouernede the hows bitaken to hym, and alle thingis that weren bitakun to hym.
And the Lord blesside the `hows of Egipcian for Joseph, and multipliede al his catel, as wel in howsis as in feeldis;
nether he knew ony other thing no but `breed which he eet. Forsothe Joseph was fair in face, and schapli in siyt.
And so aftir many daies the ladi castide hir iyen in to Joseph, and seide, Slepe thou with me;
which assentide not to the vnleueful werk, and seide to hir, Lo! while alle thingis ben bitakun to me, my lord woot not what he hath in his hows,
nether ony thing is, which is not in my power, ether which `he hath not bitake to me, outakun thee, which art his wijf; how therfor may Y do this yuel, and do synne ayens my lord?
Thei spaken siche wordis `bi alle daies, and the womman was diseseful to the yong waxynge man, and he forsook auoutrie.
Forsothe it bifelde in a dai, that Joseph entride in to the hows, and dide sum werk with out witnessis.
And sche took `the hem of his clooth, and sche seide, Slepe thou with me; and he lefte the mentil in hir hoond, and he fledde, and yede out.
And whanne the womman hadde seyn the clooth in hir hondis, and that sche was dispisid,
sche clepide to hir the men of hir hows, and seide to hem, Lo! my lord hath brouyt in an Ebrew man, that he schulde scorn vs; he entride to me to do leccherie with me, and whanne Y criede, and he herde my vois,
he lefte the mentil which Y helde, and he fledde out.
Therfor in to the preuyng of trouthe, sche schewide the mantil, holdun to the hosebonde turnynge ayen hoom.
And she seide, The Ebrew seruaunt, whom thou brouytist, entride to me to scorne me; and whanne he siy me crye,
he lefte the mentil which Y helde, and he fledde out.
And whanne these thingis weren herd, the lord bileuyde ouer myche to the wordis of the wijf, and was ful wrooth;
and he bitook Joseph in to prisoun, where the bounden men of the kyng weren kept, and he was closid there.
Forsothe the Lord was with Joseph, and hadde mercy on hym, and yaf grace to hym in the siyt of the prince of the prisoun,
which bitook in the hond of Joseph alle prisoneris that weren holdun in kepyng, and what euer thing was doon, it was vndur Joseph, nethir the prince knewe ony thing,
for alle thingis weren bitakun to Joseph; for the Lord was with hym, and dresside alle his werkis.
Whanne these thingis weren doon so, it bifelde that twei geldyngis, the boteler and the baker `of the kyng of Egipt, synneden to her lord.
And Farao was wrooth ayens hem, for the toon was `souereyn to boteleris, the tother was `souereyn to bakeris.
And he sente hem in to the prisoun of the prince of knyytis, in which also Joseph was boundun.
And the keper of the prisoun bitook hem to Joseph, which also `mynystride to hem. Sumdel of tyme passide, and thei weren hooldun in kepyng, and bothe sien a dreem in o nyyt,
bi couenable expownyng to hem.
And whanne Joseph hadde entrid to hem eerli, and hadde seyn hem sori,
he axide hem, and seide, Whi is youre `face soriere to dai than it ys wont?
Whiche answeriden, We seiyen a dreem, and `noon is that expowneth to vs. And Joseph seide to hem, Whether expownyng is not of God? Telle ye to me what ye han seyn.
The `souereyn of boteleris telde first his dreem; Y seiy that a vyne bifore me,
in which weren thre siouns, wexide litil and litil in to buriounnyngis, and that aftir flouris grapys wexiden ripe,
and the cuppe of Farao was in myn hond; therfor Y took the grapis, and presside out in to the cuppe which Y helde, and Y yaf drynk to Farao.
Joseph answerde, This is the expownyng of the dreem; thre siouns ben yit thre daies,
aftir whiche Farao schal haue mynde of thi seruyce, and he schal restore thee in to the firste degree, and thou schal yyue to hym the cuppe, bi thin office, as thou were wont to do bifore.
Oneli haue thou mynde on me, whanne it is wel to thee, and thou schalt do merci with me, that thou make suggestioun to Farao, that he lede me out of this prisoun;
for theefli Y am takun awei fro the lond of Ebrews, and here Y am sent innocent in to prisoun.
The `maister of bakeris seiye that Joseph hadde expowned prudentli the dreem, and he seide, And Y seiy a dreem, that Y hadde thre panyeris of mele on myn heed,
and Y gesside that Y bar in o panyere, that was heiyere, alle metis that ben maad bi craft of bakers, and that briddis eeten therof.
Joseph answerde, This is the expownyng of the dreem; thre panyeris ben yit thre daies,
aftir whiche Farao schal take awei thin heed, and he schal hange thee in a cros, and briddis schulen todrawe thi fleischis.
Fro thennus the thridde dai was the dai of birthe of Farao, which made a greet feeste to hise children, and hadde mynde among metis on the maistir `of boteleris, and on the prince of bakeris;
and he restoride the oon in to his place, that he schulde dresse cuppe to `the kyng,
and he hangide `the tothir in a gebat, that the treuthe of `the expownere schulde be preued.
And netheles whanne prosperitees bifelden, the `souereyn of boteleris foryat `his expownere.
Aftir twei yeer Farao seiy a dreem; he gesside that he stood on a flood,
fro which seuene faire kiyn and ful fatte stieden, and weren fed in the places of mareis;
and othere seuene, foule and leene, camen out of the flood, and weren fed in thilk brenke of the watir, in grene places;
and tho deuoureden thilke kien of whiche the fairnesse and comelynesse of bodies was wondurful.
Farao wakide, and slepte eft, and seiy another dreem; seuen eeris of corn ful and faire camen forth in o stalke,
and othere as many eeris of corn, thinne and smytun with corrupcioun of brennynge wynd,
camen forth, deuourynge al the fairenesse of the firste. Farao wakide aftir reste,
and whanne morewtid was maad, he was aferd bi inward drede, and he sente to alle the expowneris of Egipt, and to alle wise men; and whanne thei weren clepid, he telde the dreem, and noon was that expownede.
Thanne at the laste the maistir `of boteleris bithouyte, and seide, Y knowleche my synne;
the kyng was wrooth to hise seruauntis, and comaundide me and the maister `of bakeris to be cast doun in to the prisoun of the prince of knyytis,
where we bothe saien a dreem in o nyyt, biforeschewynge of thingis to comynge.
An Ebrew child, seruaunt of the same duk of knyytis was there, to whom we telden the dremes,
and herden what euer thing the bifallyng of thing preuede afterward; for Y am restorid to myn office, and he was hangid in a cros.
Anoon at the comaundement of the kyng thei polliden Joseph led out of prisoun, and whanne `the clooth was chaungid, thei brouyten Joseph to the kyng.
To whom the kyng seide, Y seiye dremes, and noon is that expowneth tho thingis that Y seiy, I haue herd that thou expownest moost prudentli.
Joseph answerde, With out me, God schal answere prosperitees to Farao.
Therfor Farao telde that that he seiy; Y gesside that Y stood on the brenke of the flood,
and seuene kiyn, ful faire and with fleischis able to etyng, stieden fro the watir, whiche kiyn gaderiden grene seggis in the pasture of the marreis;
and lo! seuene othere kiyn, so foule and leene, sueden these, that Y seiy neuere siche in the lond of Egipt;
and whanne the formere kien weren deuourid and wastid, tho secounde yauen no steppe of fulnesse,
but weren slowe bi lijk leenesse and palenesse. I wakide, and eft Y was oppressid bi sleep, and Y seiy a dreem;
seuene eeris of corn, ful and faireste, camen forth in o stalke,
and othere seuene, thinne and smytun with `corrupcioun of brennynge wynd, camen forth of the stobil,
whiche deuouriden the fairenesse of the formere;
Y telde the dreem to expowneris, and no man is that expowneth. Joseph answerde, The dreem of the king is oon; God schewide to Farao what thingis he schal do.
Seuene faire kiyn, and seuene ful eeris of corn, ben seuene yeeris of plentee, and tho comprehenden the same strengthe of dreem;
and seuene kiyn thinne and leene, that stieden aftir tho, and seuene thinne eeris of corn and smytun with brennynge wynd, ben seuene yeer of hungur to comynge,
whiche schulen be fillid bi this ordre.
Lo! seuene yeer of greet plentee in al the lond of Egipt schulen come,
and seuene othre yeer of so greet bareynesse schulen sue tho, that al the abundaunce bifore be youun to foryetyng; for the hungur schal waste al the lond,
and the greetnesse of pouert schal leese the greetnesse of plentee.
Forsothe this that thou siyest the secunde tyme a dreem, perteynynge to the same thing, is a `schewyng of sadnesse, for the word of God schal be doon, and schal be fillid ful swiftli.
Now therfor puruey the kyng a wijs man and a redi, and make the kyng hym souereyn to the lond of Egipt,
which man ordeyne gouernouris bi alle cuntreis, and gadere he in to bernys the fyuethe part of fruytis bi seuene yeer of plentee,
that schulen come now; and al the wheete be kept vndur the power of Farao, and be it kept in citees,
and be it maad redi to the hungur to comynge of seuene yeer that schal oppresse Egipt, and the lond be not wastid bi pouert.
The counsel pleside Farao,
and alle his mynystris, and he spak to hem, Wher we moun fynde sich a man which is ful of Goddis spirit?
Therfor Farao seide to Joseph, For God hath schewid to thee alle thingis whiche thou hast spoke, wher Y mai fynde a wisere man and lijk thee?
Therfor thou schalt be ouer myn hous, and al the puple schal obeie to the comaundement of thi mouth; Y schal passe thee onely by o trone of the rewme.
And eft Farao seide to Joseph, Lo! Y haue ordeyned thee on al the lond of Egipt.
And Farao took the ryng fro his hond, and yaf it in the hond of Joseph, and he clothide Joseph with a stoole of bijs, and puttide a goldun wrethe aboute the necke;
and Farao made Joseph to `stie on his secounde chare, while a bidele criede, that alle men schulden knele bifore hym, and schulden knowe that he was souereyn of al the lond of Egipt.
And the kyng seide to Joseph, Y am Farao, without thi comaundement no man shal stire hond ether foot in al the lond of Egipt.
And he turnede the name of Joseph, and clepide him bi Egipcian langage, the sauyour of the world; and he yaf to Joseph a wijf, Asenech, the douyter of Potifar, preest of Heliopoleos. And so Joseph yede out to the lond of Egipt.
Forsothe Joseph was of thretti yeer, whanne he stood in the siyt of kyng Farao, and cumpasside alle the cuntreis of Egipt.
And the plente of seuene yeer cam, and ripe corn weren bounden into handfuls, and weren gaderid into the bernys of Egipt,
also al the aboundaunce of cornes weren kept in alle citeis,
and so greet aboundaunce was of wheete, that it was maad euene to the grauel of the see, and the plente passide mesure.
Sotheli twei sones were born to Joseph bifor that the hungur came, whiche Asenech, douytir of Putifar, preest of Heliopoleos, childide to hym.
And he clepide the name of the firste gendrid sone, Manasses, and seide, God hath maad me to foryete alle my traueilis, and the hous of my fadir;
and he clepide the name of the secunde sone Effraym, and seide, God hath maad me to encreesse in the lond of my pouert.
Therfor whanne seuene yeer of plentee that weren in Egipt weren passid,
seuene yeer of pouert bigunnen to come, whiche Joseph bifore seide, and hungur hadde the maistri in al the world; also hungur was in al the lond of Egipt;
and whanne that lond hungride, the puple criede to Farao, and axide metis; to whiche he answeride, Go ye to Joseph, and do ye what euer thing he seith to you.
Forsothe hungur encreesside ech dai in al the lond, and Joseph openyde alle the bernys, and seelde to Egipcians, for also hungur oppresside hem;
and alle prouynces camen in to Egipt to bie metis, and to abate the yuel of nedynesse.
Forsothe Jacob herde that foodis weren seeld in Egipt, and he seide to hise sones, Whi ben ye necgligent?
Y herde that wheete is seeld in Egipt, go ye doun, and bie ye necessaries to vs, that we moun lyue, and be not wastid bi nedynesse.
Therfor ten britheren of Joseph yeden doun to bie wheete in Egipt,
and Beniamyn was withholdun of Jacob at hoome, that seide to hise britheren, Lest perauenture in the weie he suffre ony yuel.
Sotheli thei entriden in to the lond of Egipt, with othere men that yeden to bie; forsothe hungur was in the lond of Canaan.
And Joseph was prince of Egipt, and at his wille whetis weren seeld to puplis. And whanne hise britheren hadden worschipid hym,
and he hadde knowe hem, he spak hardere as to aliens, and axide hem, Fro whennus camen ye? Whiche answeriden, Fro the lond of Canaan, that we bie necessaries to lyiflode.
And netheles he knewe the britheren, and he was not knowun of hem,
and he bithouyte on the dremys whiche he seiy sumtyme. And he seide to hem, Ye ben aspieris, ye camen to se the feblere thingis of the lond.
Whiche seiden, Lord, it is not so, but thi seruauntis camen to bie metis;
alle we ben the sones of o man, we comen pesible, and thi seruauntis ymaginen not ony yuel.
To `whiche he answeride, It is in other maner, ye camen to se the feble thingis of the lond.
And thei seiden, `We twelue britheren, thi seruauntis, ben sones of o man in the lond of Canaan; the leeste is with oure fadir, an other is not `on erthe.
This it is, he seide, that Y spak to you,
ye ben aspieris, riyt now Y schal take experience of you, bi the helthe of Farao ye schulen not go fro hennus, til youre leeste brother come; sende ye oon of you,
that he brynge hym, forsothe ye schulen be in boondis, til tho thingis that ye seiden ben preued, whether tho ben false ether trewe; ellis, bi the helthe of Farao, ye ben aspieris.
Therfor he bitook hem to kepyng thre daies; sotheli in the thridde dai,
whanne thei weren led out of prisoun, he seide, Do ye that that Y seide, and ye schulen lyue, for Y drede God;
if ye ben pesible, o brother of you be boundun in prisoun; forsothe go ye, and bere wheetis, whiche ye bouyten,
in to youre housis, and brynge ye youre leeste brother to me, that Y may preue youre wordis, and ye die not. Thei diden as he seide,
and thei spaken togidere, Skilfuli we suffren these thingis, for we synneden ayens oure brother, and we seiyen the anguysch of his soule, while he preiede vs, and we herden not; herfore this tribulacioun cometh on vs.
Of which oon, Ruben, seide, Whether Y seide not to yow, Nyle ye do synne ayens the child, and ye herden not me? lo! his blood is souyt.
Sotheli thei wisten not that Joseph vndirstood, for he spak to hem by interpretour.
And he turnede awei hym silf a litil and wepte; and he turnede ayen, and spak to hem.
And he took Symeon, and boond hym, while thei weren present; and he comaundide the mynystris, that thei schulden fille her sackis with wheete, and that thei schulden putte the money `of alle in her baggis, and ouer this yyue metis in the weie; whiche diden so.
And thei `baren wetis on her assis, and yeden forth,
and whanne the sak of oon was opened that he schulde yyue meete to the werk beeste in the yn, he bihelde the money in the mouth of the bagge,
and seide to his britheren, My monei is yoldun to me, lo! it is had in the bagge; and thei weren astonyed, and troblid, and seiden togidere, What thing is this that God hath doon to us.
And thei camen to Jacob, her fadir, in the loond of Canaan, and telden to hym alle thingis that bifelden to hem, and seiden,
The lord of the lond spak harde to vs, and gesside that we weren aspieris of the prouynce;
to whom we answeriden, We ben pesible, nether we purposen ony tresouns;
we ben twelue britheren, gendrid of o fadir, oon is not `on erthe, the leeste dwellith with the fadir in the lond of Canaan.
And he seide to vs, Thus Y schal preue that ye ben pesible; leeffe ye o brother of you with me, and take ye metis nedeful to youre housis, and go ye, and brynge ye to me youre leeste brother,
that Y wite that ye ben not aspieris, and that ye moun resseyue this brother which is holdun in boondis, and that fro thennus forth ye haue licence to bie what thingis ye wolen.
While these thingis weren seide, whanne alle schedden out wheetis, thei founden money boundun in `the mouth of sackis. And whanne alle togidere weren aferd,
the fadir Jacob seide, Ye han maad me to be with out children; Joseph is not alyue, Symeon is holdun in bondis, ye schulen take a wey fro me Beniamyn; alle these yuels felden in me.
To whom Ruben answeride, Sle thou my twei sones, if Y shal not brynge hym ayen to thee; take thou hym in myn hond, and Y schal restore hym to thee.
And Jacob seide, My sone schal not go doun with you; his brother is deed, he aloone is left; if ony aduersite schal bifalle `to hym in the lond to which ye schulen go, ye schulen lede forth myn hoore heeris with sorewe to hellis.
In the meene tyme hungur oppresside greetli al the lond;
and whanne the meetis weren wastid, whiche thei brouyten fro Egipt, Jacob seide to hise sones, Turne ye ayen, and bie ye a litil of meetis to vs.
Judas answeride, The ilke man denounside to vs vndir witnessyng of an ooth, and seide, Ye schulen not se my face, if ye schulen not brynge with you youre leeste brother;
therfor if thou wolt sende hym with vs, we schulen go to gidere, and we schulen bie necessaries to thee;
ellis if thou wolt not, we schulen not go; for as we seiden ofte, the man denounside to vs, and seide, Ye schulen not se my face with out youre leeste brother.
Forsothe Israel seide to hem, Ye diden this in to my wretchidnesse, that ye schewiden to hym, that ye hadden also another brother.
And thei answeriden, The man axide vs bi ordre oure generacioun, if the fadir lyuede, if we hadden a brother; and we answeriden suyngli to hym, bi that that he axide; whether we myyten wite that he wolde seie, Brynge ye youre brothir with you?
And Judas seide to his fadir, Sende the child with me, that we go, and moun lyue, lest we dien, and oure litle children ;
Y take the child, require thou hym of myn hoond; if Y schal not brynge ayen, and bitake hym to thee, Y schal be gilti of synne ayens thee in al tyme;
if delai hadde not be, we hadden come now anothir tyme.
Therfor Israel, `the fadir of hem, seide to hem, If it is nede so, do ye that that ye wolen; `take ye of the beste fruytis of the lond in youre vesselis, and `bere ye yiftis to the man, a litil of gumme, and of hony, and of storax, and of mirre, and of therebynte, and of alemaundis;
and `bere ye with you double money, and `bere ye ayen that money which ye founden in baggis, lest perauenture it be doon bi errour;
but also take ye youre brother, and go ye to the man;
forsothe my God Almyyti mak him pesible to you, and sende he ayen youre brother, whom he holdith in boondis, and this Beniamyn; forsothe Y schal be as maad bare without sones.
Therfor the men token yiftis, and double monei, and Beniamyn; and thei yeden doun in to Egipt, and stoden bifore Joseph.
And whanne he hadde seyn `hem and Beniamyn togidere, he comaundide the dispendere of his hows, and seide, Lede these men in to the hous, and sle beestis, and make a feeste; for thei schulen ete with me to dai.
He dide as it was comaundid, and ledde the men in to the hows;
and there thei weren aferd, and seiden to gidere, We ben brouyt in for the monei which we baren ayen bifore in oure sackis, that he putte chalenge `in to vs, and make suget bi violence to seruage bothe vs and oure assis.
Wherfor thei neiyeden in the `yatis, and spaken to the dispendere,
Lord, we preien that thou here vs; we camen doun now bifore that we schulden bie metis;
whanne tho weren bouyt, whanne we camen to the ynne, we openeden oure baggis, and we founden money in the mouth of sackis, which money we han brouyt ayen now in the same weiyte;
but also we han brouyt other siluer, that we bie tho thingis that ben nedeful to vs; it is not in oure conscience, who puttide the money in oure pursis.
And he answerde, Pees be to you, nyle ye drede; youre God and God of youre fadir yaf to you tresouris in youre baggis; for I haue the monei preued, which ye yauen to me. And he ledde out Symeon to hem;
and whanne thei weren brouyt in to the hows, he brouyte watir, and thei waischiden her feet, and he yaf `meetis to her assis.
Sotheli thei maden redi yiftis til Joseph entride at myd day, for thei hadden herd that thei schulden ete breed there.
Therfor Joseph entride in to his hows, and thei offriden yiftis to hym, and helden in the hondis, and worschipiden lowe to erthe.
And he grette hem ayen mekeli; and he axide hem, and seide, Whether youre fadir, the elde man, is saaf, of whom ye seiden to me? lyueth he yit?
Whiche answeriden, He is hool, thi seruaunt oure fadir lyueth yit; and thei weren bowid, and worschipiden hym.
Forsothe Joseph reyside hise iyen, and siy Beniamyn his brother of the same wombe, and seide, Is this youre litil brother, of whom ye seiden to me? And eft Joseph seide, My sone, God haue merci of thee.
And Joseph hastide in to the hous, for his entrailis weren moued on his brother, and teeris brasten out, and he entride into a closet, and wepte.
And eft whanne the face was waischun, he yede out, and refreynede hym silf, and seide, Sette ye looues.
`And whanne tho weren set to Joseph by hym silf, and to the britheren bi hem silf, and to Egipcyans that eeten to gidre by hem silf; for it is vnleueful to Egipcians to ete with Ebrewis, and thei gessen sich a feeste vnhooli.
Therfor thei saten bifore hym, the firste gendrid bi the rite of his firste gendryng, and the leeste bi his age; and thei wondriden greetli,
whanne the partis weren takun whiche thei hadden resseyued of him, and the more part cam to Beniamyn, so that it passide in fyue partis; and thei drunken, and weren fillid with him.
Forsothe Joseph comaundid the dispendere of his hous, and seide, Fille thou her sackis with wheete, as myche as tho moun take, and putte thou the money of ech in the hiynesse of the sak;
forsothe put thou in the mouth of the sak of the yongere my silueren cuppe, and the prijs of wheete which he yaf; and it was doon so.
And whanne the morewtid roos, thei weren delyuered with her assis.
And now thei hadden go out of the citee, and hadden go forth a litil; thanne Joseph seide, whanne the dispendere of his hous was clepid, Rise thou, pursue the men, and seye thou whanne thei ben takun, Whi han ye yolde yuel for good?
The cuppe, which ye han stole, is thilk in which my lord drynkith, and in which he is wont to dyuyne; ye han do a ful wickid thing.
He dide as Joseph comaundid, and whanne thei weren takun, he spak bi ordre.
Whiche answeriden, Whi spekith oure lord so, that thi seruauntis han do so greet trespas?
We brouyten ayen to thee fro the lond of Chanaan the monei which we founden in the hiynesse of sackis, and hou is it suynge that we han stole fro `the hows of thi lord gold ether siluer?
At whom euere of thi seruauntis this that thou sekist is foundun, die he, and we schulen be seruauntis of my lord.
Which seide to hem, Be it doon bi youre sentence; at whom it is foundun, be he my seruaunt; forsothe ye schulen be gilteles.
And so thei diden doun hastili the sackis on erthe, and alle openyden tho whiche he souyte;
and bigan at the more til to the leeste, and foond the cuppe in `the sak of Beniamyn.
And whanne thei hadden `to-rent her clothis, and hadden chargid eft the assis, thei turneden ayen in to the citee.
And Judas entride `the firste with brithren to Joseph; for he hadde not go yit fro the place; and alle felden togidere on erthe bifore hym.
To whiche he seide, Whi wolden ye do so? whether ye witen not, that noon is lijk me in the kunnyng of dyuinyng?
To whom Judas seide, What schulen we answere to my lord, ether what schulen we speke, ether moun iustli ayenseie? God hath founde the wickidnesse of thi seruauntis; lo! alle we ben the seruauntis of my lord, bothe we and he at whom the cuppe is foundun.
Joseph answeride, Fer be it fro me, that Y do so; he be my seruaunt that stal the cuppe; forsothe go ye fre to youre fadir.
Sotheli Judas neiyede neer, and seide tristili, My lord, Y preye, thi seruaunt speke a word in thin eeris, and be thou not wrooth to thi seruaunt; for aftir Farao thou art my lord.
Thou axidist first thi seruauntis, Han ye a fadir, ether a brother?
And we answeriden to thee, my lord, An eld fadir is to vs, and a litil child that was borun in his eelde, whos brother of the same wombe is deed, and his modir hath hym aloone; forsothe his fadir loueth hym tendirli.
And thou seidist to thi seruauntis, Brynge ye hym to me, and Y schal sette myn iyen on hym.
We maden suggestioun to thee, my lord, the child may not forsake his fadir; for if he schal leeue the fadir, he schal die.
And thou seidist to thi seruauntis, If youre leeste brother schal not come with you, ye schulen no more se my face.
Therfor whanne we hadden stied to thi seruaunt, oure fadir, we telden to hym alle thingis whiche my lord spak; and oure fadir seide,
Turne ye ayen, and bie ye to you a litil of wheete;
to whom we seiden, We moun not go; if oure leeste brother schal go doun with vs, we schulen go forth togidere; ellis, if he is absent, we doren not se the `face of the lord.
To whiche thingis the fadir answeride, Ye witen that my wiif childide twei sones to me;
oon yede out, and ye seiden, a beeste deuouride hym, and hidir to he apperith not;
if ye taken also this sone, and ony thing bifallith to hym in the weye, ye schulen lede forth myn hoor heeris with morenyng to hellis.
Therfor if Y entre to thi seruaunt, oure fadir, and the child faile, sithen his lijf hangith of the lijf of the child,
and he se that the child is not with vs, he schal die, and thi seruauntis schulen lede forth hise hoor heeris with sorewe to hellis.
Be Y propirli thi seruaunt, which resseyuede this child on my feith, and bihiyte, and seide, If Y schal not brynge ayen hym, Y schal be gilti of synne ayens my fadir in al tyme;
and so Y schal dwelle thi seruaunt for the child in to the seruyce of my lord, and the child stie with hise britheren;
for Y may not go ayen to my fadir, if the child is absent, lest Y stonde a witnesse of the wretchidnesse that schal oppresse my fadir.
Joseph myyte no lengere absteyne hym silf, while many men stoden bifore; wherfor he comaundide that alle men schulden go out, and that noon alien were present in the knowyng of Joseph and hise britheren.
And Joseph reiside the vois with wepyng, which Egipcians herden, and al the hows of Farao.
And he seide to hise britheren, Y am Joseph; lyueth my fadir yit? The brithren myyten not answere, and weren agast bi ful myche drede.
To whiche he seide mekeli, Neiye ye to me. And whanne thei hadden neiyed nyy, he seide, Y am Joseph youre brother, whom ye selden in to Egipt;
nyle ye drede, nether seme it to be hard to you, that ye seelden me in to these cuntreis; for God hath sent me bifore you in to Egipt for youre helthe.
For it is twei yeer that hungur bigan `to be in the lond, yit fyue yeer suen, in whiche me schal not mow ere, nether repe;
and God bifor sente me, that ye be reserued on erthe, and moun haue metis to lyue.
Y was sent hidur not bi youre counsel, but bi Goddis wille, which made me as the fadir of Farao, and the lord of al his hows, and prince in al the lond of Egipt.
Haste ye, and `stie ye to my fadir, and ye schulen seie to hym, Thi sone Joseph sendith these thingis; God hath maad me lord of al the lond of Egipt; come doun to me, and tarie not, and dwelle in the lond of Gessen;
and thou schalt be bisidis me, thou, and thi sones, and the sones of thi sones, thi scheep, and thi grete beestis, and alle thingis whiche thou weldist,
and there Y schal fede thee; for yit fyue yeer of hungur ben residue, lest bothe thou perische, and thin hows, and alle thingis whiche thou weldist.
Lo! youre iyen, and the iyen of my brother Beniamyn seen, that my mouth spekith to you;
telle ye to my fadir al my glorie, and alle thingis whiche ye sien in Egipt; haste ye, and brynge ye hym to me.
And whanne he hadde biclippid, and hadde feld in to the necke of Beniamyn, his brother, he wepte, the while also Benjamin wepte in lijk maner on the necke of Joseph.
And Joseph kisside alle hise britheren, and wepte on alle; aftir whiche thingis thei weren hardi to speke to hym.
And it was herd, and pupplischid bi famouse word in the halle of the kyng, The britheren of Joseph ben comun. And Farao ioiede, and al his meynee;
and Farao seide to Joseph, that he schulde comaunde hise britheren, and `seie, Charge youre beestis, and go ye in to the lond of Canaan,
and take ye fro thennus youre fadir, and kynrede, and come ye to me; and Y schal yyue to you alle the goodis of Egipt, that ye ete the merow of the lond.
Comaunde thou also, that thei take waynes of the lond of Egipt to the cariage of her litle children, and wyues, and seie thou, `Take ye youre fadir, and haste ye comynge soone,
nether leeue ye ony thing of the purtenaunce of youre hows, for alle the richessis of Egipt schulen be youre.
The sones of Israel diden, as it was comaundid to hem; to whiche Joseph yaf waynes, bi the comaundement of Farao, and metis in the weie;
and he comaundide twei stoolis to be brouyt forth to ech; forsothe he yaf to Beniamyn thre hundrid platis of siluer, with fyue the beste stoolis;
and sente to his fadir so myche of siluer, and of cloothis, and he addide to hem ten male assis, that schulden bere of alle richessis of Egipt, and so many femal assis, berynge wheete and looues in the weie.
Therfor he lefte hise britheren, and seide to hem goynge forth, Be ye not wrooth in the weie.
Whiche stieden fro Egipt, and camen in to the lond of Canaan, to her fadir Jacob;
and telden to hym, and seiden, Joseph, thi sone, lyueth, and he is lord in al the lond of Egipt. And whanne this was herd, Jacob wakide as of a greuouse sleep; netheles he bileuyde not to hem.
Thei telden ayenward al the ordre of the thing; and whanne Jacob hadde seyn the waynes, and alle thingis whiche Joseph hadde sent, his spirit lyuede ayen,
and he seide, It suffisith to me, if Joseph my sone lyueth yit, Y schal go and `Y schal se hym bifore that Y die.
And Israel yede forth with alle thingis that he hadde, and he cam to the pit of ooth; and whanne sacrifices weren slayn there to God of his fadir Isaac,
he herde God bi a visioun in that nyyt clepynge hym, `and seiynge to hym, Jacob! Jacob! To whom he answeride, Lo! Y am present.
God seide to hym, Y am the strongeste God of thi fadir; nyle thou drede, go doun in to Egipt, for Y schal make thee there in to a greet folk;
Y schal go doun thidir with thee, and Y schal brynge thee turnynge ayen fro thennus, and Joseph schal sette his hond on thin iyen.
Jacob roos fro the pit of ooth, and the sones token him, with her litle children, and wyues, in the waynes whiche Farao hadde sent to bere the eld man,
and alle thingis whiche he weldide in the lond of Canaan; and he cam in to Egipt with his seed,

Forsothe the sones of Joseph, that weren borun to hym in `the loond of Egipt, weren two men. Alle the soulis of `the hows of Jacob, that entriden in to Egipt, weren seuenti.
Forsothe Jacob sente Judas bifore hym to Joseph, that he schulde telle to hym, and he schulde `come in to Gessen.
And whanne Jacob hadde come thidir, Joseph stiede in his chare to mete his fadir at the same place. And he siy Jacob, and felde on `his necke, and wepte bitwixe collyngis.
And the fadir seide to Joseph, Now Y schal die ioiful, for Y siy thi face, and Y leeue thee lyuynge.
And Joseph spak to hise brithren, and to al `the hows of his fadir, I schal stie, and `Y schal telle to Farao, and Y schal seie to hym, My britheren, and the hows of my fadir, that weren in the lond of Canaan, ben comun to me,
and thei ben men kepers of scheep, and han bisynesse of flockis to be fed; thei brouyten with hem her scheep and grete beestis, and alle thingis whiche thei miyten haue.
And whanne Farao schal clepe you, and schal seie, What is youre werk?

Therfor Joseph entride, and telde to Farao, and seide, My fadir and brethren, the scheep and grete beestis of hem, and alle thingis whiche thei welden, camen fro the lond of Canaan; and lo! thei stonden in the lond of Gessen.
And he ordeynede fyue, the laste men of hise britheren, bifore the kyng,

we camen in to thi lond to be pilgrymys, for noo gras is to the flockis of thi seruauntis; hungur wexith greuouse in the lond of Canaan, and we axen that thou comaunde vs thi seruauntis to be in the lond of Gessen.
And so the kyng seide to Joseph, Thi fadir and thi britheren camen to thee;
the lond of Egipt is in thi siyt, make thou hem to dwelle in the beste place, and yyue thou to hem the lond of Gessen; that if thou woost that witti men ben in hem, ordeyne thou hem maystris of my beestis.
After these thingis Joseph brouyte in his fader to the king, and settide him bifor the king, which blesside the king;
and he was axid of the king, Hou many ben the daies of the yeeris of thi lijf?
And he answeride, The daies of pilgrymage of my lijf, ben feewe and yuele, of an hundrid and thretti yeer, and tho `camen not til to the daies of my fadris, in whiche thei weren pilgryms.
And whanne he hadde blessid the kyng, he yede out.
Forsothe Joseph yaf to hise fadir and britheren possessioun in Egipt, in Ramasses, the beste soile of erthe, as Farao comaundide;
and he fedde hem, and al the hows of his fadir, and yaf metis to alle.
For breed failide in al the world, and hungur oppresside the lond, moost of Egipt and of Canaan;
of whiche londis he gaderide al the money for the sillyng of wheete, and brouyte it in to the `tresorie of the kyng.
And whanne prijs failide to the bieris, al Egipt cam to Joseph, and seide, Yyue thou `looues to vs; whi shulen we die bifore thee, while monei failith?
To whiche he answeride, Brynge ye youre beestis, and Y schal yyue to you metis for tho, if ye han not prijs.
And whanne thei hadden brouyt tho, he yaf to hem metis for horsis, and scheep, and oxun, and assis; and he susteynede hem in that yeer for the chaungyng of beestis.
And thei camen in the secunde yeer, and seiden to hym, We helen not fro oure lord, that the while monei failith, also beestis failiden togidere, nether it is hid fro thee, that with out bodies and lond we han no thing;
whi therfor schulen we die, while thou seest? bothe we and oure lond schulen be thine, bie thou vs in to the kyngis seruage, and yyue thou seedis, lest the while the tiliere perischith, the lond be turned in to wildirnesse.
Therfor Joseph bouyte al the lond of Egipt, while all men seelden her possessiouns, for the greetnesse of hungur;
and he made it and alle puplis therof suget to Farao, fro the laste termes of Egipt til to the laste endis therof,
outakun the lond of preestis, that was youun of the kyng to hem, to whiche preestis also metis weren youun of the comun bernys, and therfor thei weren not compellid to sille her possessiouns.
Therfor Joseph seide to the puplis, Lo! as ye seen, Farao weldith bothe you and youre lond; take ye seedis, and `sowe ye feeldis,
that ye moun haue fruytis; ye schulen yyue the fifthe part to the kyng; Y suffre to you the foure residue partis in to seed and in to meetis, to you, and to youre fre children.
Whiche answeriden, Oure helthe is in thin hond; oneli oure God biholde vs, and we schulen ioifuli serue the kyng.
For that tyme til in to present dai, in al the lond of Egipt, the fyuethe part is paied to the kyngis, and it is maad as in to a lawe, with out the lond of preestis, that was fre fro this condicioun.
Therfor Israel dwellide in Egipt, that is, in the lond of Jessen, and weldide it; and he was encreessid and multiplied ful mych.
And he lyuede therynne sixtene yeer; and alle the daies of his lijf weren maad of an hundrid and seuene and fourti yeer.
And whanne he seiy the dai of deeth nyye, he clepide his sone Joseph, and seide to hym, If Y haue founde grace in thi siyt; putte thin hond vndur myn hipe, and thou schal do merci and treuthe to me, that thou birie not me in Egipt;
but `Y schal slepe with my fadris, and take thou awey me fro this lond, and birie in the sepulcre of my grettere. To whom Joseph answeride, Y schal do that that thou comaundist.
And Israel seide, Therfor swere thou to me; and whanne Joseph swoor, Israel turnede to the heed of the bed, and worschipide God.
And so whanne these thingis weren don, it was teld to Joseph, that his fadir was sijk. And he took hise twei sones, Manasses and Effraym, and he disposide to go.
And it was seid to the elde man, Lo! thi sone Joseph cometh to thee; which was coumfortid, and sat in the bed.
And whanne Joseph entride to hym, he seide, Almyyti God apperide to me in Luza, which is in the lond of Canaan, and blesside me,
and seide, Y schal encreesse and multiplie thee, and Y schal make thee in to cumpanyes of puplis, and Y schal yyue to thee this lond, and to thi seed aftir thee, in to euerlastinge possessioun.
Therfor thi twei sones, that ben borun to thee in the lond of Egipt bifore that Y cam hidir to thee, schulen be myne, Effraym and Manasses as Ruben and Symeon schulen be arettid to me;
forsothe the othere whiche thou schalt gendre aftir hem schulen be thine; and thei schulen be clepid bi the name of her britheren in her possessiouns.
Forsothe whanne Y cam fro Mesopotamye, Rachel was deed to me in the lond of Canaan, in thilke weie; and it was the bigynnyng of somer; and Y entride in to Effrata, and beriede hir bisidis the weie of Effrata, which bi anothir name is clepid Bethleem.
Forsothe Jacob seiy the sones of Joseph, and seide to him, Who ben these?
He answeride, Thei ben my sones, whiche God yaf to me in this place. Jacob seide, Brynge hem to me that Y blesse hem.
For `the iyen of Israel, dasewiden for greet eelde, and he myyte not se clereli; and he kisside and collide tho children ioyned to hym, and seide to his sone,
Y am not defraudid of thi siyt; ferthermore God schewide to me thi seed.
And whanne Joseph hadde take hem fro `the fadris lappe, he worschipide lowe to erthe.
And he sette Effraym on his riyt side, that is, on the lift side of Israel; forsothe he settide Manasses in his lift side, that is, on the riyt side of the fadir; and he ioynede bothe to hym.
Which helde forth the riyt hond, and settide on `the heed of Effraym, the lesse brothir; sotheli he settide the left hond on `the heed of Manasses, that was the more thury birthe. Jacob chaungide `the hondes,
and blesside his sone Joseph, and seide, God, in whos siyt my fadris Abraham and Isaac yeden; God, that fedith me fro my yong wexynge age til in to present day;
the aungel that delyuerede me fro alle yuelis, blesse thes children, and my name be clepid on hem, and the names of my fadris Abraham and Ysaac; and wexe thei in multitude on erthe.
Forsothe Joseph seiy that his fadir hadde set the riyt hond on the heed of Effraym, and took heuyli, and he enforside to reise the fadris hond takun fro the heed of Effraym, and to bere `ouer on `the heed of Manasses.
And he seide to the fadir, Fadir, it acordith not so; for this is the firste gendrid; sette thi riyt hond on the heed `of hym.
Which forsook and seide, Y woot, my sone, Y woot; and sotheli this child schal be in to puplis, and he schal be multiplied; but his yonger brother schal be more than he, and `his seed schal encreesse in to folkis.
And he blesside hem in that tyme, and seide, Israel schal be blessid in thee, Joseph, and it schal be seid, God do to thee as to Effraym and as to Manasses. And he settide Effraym bifore Manasses;
and seide to Joseph, his sone, Lo! Y die, and God schal be with you, and schal lede you ayen to the lond of youre fadris;
Y yyue to thee o part ouer thi britheren which Y took fro the hand of Amorei, in my swerd and bowe.
Forsothe Jacob clepide hise sones, and seide to hem, Be ye gaderid that Y telle what thingis schulen come to you in the laste daies;
be ye gaderid, `and here, ye sones of Jacob, here ye Israel youre fadir.
Ruben, my firste gendrid sone, thou art my strengthe and the bigynnyng of my sorewe; thou ouytist to be the former in yiftis, the more in lordschip;
thou art sched out as watir; wexe thou not, for thou stiedist on the bed of thi fader, and defoulidist his bed.
Symeon and Leuy, britheren, fiytynge vessils of wickidnesse;
my soule come not in to the councel of hem, and my glorie be not in the congregacioun of hem; for in her woodnesse thei killiden a man, and in her wille thei myneden the wal;
curside be the woodnesse of hem, for it is obstynat, and the indignacioun of hem for it is hard; Y schal departe hem in Jacob, and I schal scatere hem in Israel.
Judas, thi britheren schulen preise thee, thin hondis schulen be in the nollis of thin enemyes; the sones of thi fadir schulen worschipe thee.
`A whelp of lioun `is Judas; my sone thou stiedist to prey; thou restidist, and hast leyn as a lioun, and as a lionesse who schal reise hym?
The septre schal not be takun awey fro Juda, and a duyk of his hipe, til he come that schal be sent, and he schal be abiding of hethene men;
and he schal tye his colt at the vyner, and his femal asse at the vyne; A! my sone, he schal waische his stoole in wyn, and his mentil in the blood of grape;
hise iyen ben fairere than wyn, and hise teeth ben whittere than mylk.
Zabulon schal dwelle in the brenk of the see, and in the stondyng of schipis; and schal stretche til to Sydon.
Isachar, a strong asse,
liggynge bitwixe termes, seiy reste, that it was good and seiy the lond that it was best, and he vndirsettide his schuldre to bere, and he was maad seruynge to tributis.
Dan schal deme his puple, as also another lynage in Israel.
Dan be maad a serpent in the weie, and cerastes in the path, and bite the feet of an hors, that the `stiere therof falle bacward; Lord,
Y schal abide thin helthe.
Gad schal be gird, and schal fiyte bifor hym, and he schal be gird bihynde.
Aser his breed schal be plenteuouse, and he schal yyue delicis to kyngis.
Neptalym schal be an hert sent out, and yyuynge spechis of fairenesse.
Joseph, a sone encreessynge, `a sone encresinge, and fair in biholdyng; douytris runnen aboute on the wal,
but hise brithren wraththeden hym, and chidden, and thei hadden dartis, and hadden enuye to hym.
His bowe sat in the stronge, and the boondis of his armes, and hondis weren vnboundun bi the hond of the myyti of Jacob; of hym a scheepherd yede out, the stoon of Israel.
God of thi fadir schal be thin helpere, and Almyyti God schal blesse thee with blessyngis of heuene fro aboue, and with blessyngis of the see liggynge binethe, with blessyngis of tetis, and of wombe;
the blessyngis of thi fadir ben coumfortid, the blessyngis of his fadris, til the desire of euerlastynge hillis cam; blessyngis ben maad in the heed of Joseph, and in the nol of Nazarei among his britheren.
Beniamyn, a rauyschynge wolf, schal ete prey eerly, and in the euentid he schal departe spuylis.
Alle these weren in twelue kynredis of Israel; her fadir spak these thingys to hem, and blesside hem alle by propre blessyngis,
and comaundide hem, and seide, Y am gaderid to my puple, birie ye me with my fadris in the double denne, which is in the lond of Efron Ethei, ayens Manbre,
in the lond of Canaan, which denne Abraham bouyte with the feeld of Efron Ethei, in to possessioun of sepulcre.
There thei birieden hym, and Sare his wijf, also Ysaac was biried there with Rebecca his wijf; there also Lia liggith biried.
And whanne the comaundementis weren endid, bi whiche he tauyte the sones, he gaderide hise feet on the bed, and diede, and he was put to his puple.

Which thing Joseph seiy, and felde on `the face of the fader, and wepte, and kiste hym;
and he comaundide hise seruauntis, lechis, that thei schulden anoynte the fadir with swete smellynge spiceries.
While thei `filliden the comaundementis, fourti daies passiden, for this was the custom of deed bodies anoyntid; and Egipt biwepte hym seuenti daies.
And whanne the tyme of weiling was fillid, Joseph spak to the meyne of Farao, If Y haue founde grace in youre siyt, speke ye in the eeris of Farao; for my fadir chargide me,
and seide, Lo! Y die, thou schalt birie me in my sepulcre which Y diggide to me in the lond of Canaan; therfor Y schal stie that Y birie my fadir, and Y schal turne ayen.
And Farao seide to hym, Stie, and birie thi fader, as thou art chargid.
And whanne `he stiede, alle the elde men of `the hous of Farao yeden with him, and alle the grettere men in birthe of the lond of Egipt; the hous of Joseph with her britheren,
without litle children, and flockis, and grete beestis, whiche thei leften in the lond of Gessen, yeden with him.
And he hadde charis, and horsmen, and felouschip, and cumpany was maad not litil.
And thei camen to the cornfloor of Adad, which is set ouer Jordan, where thei maden the seruice of the deed bodi, with greet weilyng and strong, and fillide seuen daies.
And whanne the dwellers of the lond of Canaan hadden seyn this, thei seiden, This is a greet weiling to Egipcians; and therfor thei clepiden the name of that place the weilyng of Egipt.
Therfor the sones of Jacob diden, as he hadde comaundid to hem;
and thei baren hym in to the lond of Canaan, and thei birieden hym in the double denne, which denne with the feeld Abraham hadde bouyt of Effron Ethei, ayens the face of Mambre, into possessioun of sepulcre.
And Joseph turnede ayen in to Egipt with hise britheren and al the felouschipe, whanne the fadir was biried.
And whanne the fadir was deed, the britheren of Joseph dredden, and spaken togidere, lest perauenture he be myndeful of the wrong which he suffride, and yelde to vs al the yuel, that we diden.
And thei senten to hym, and seiden, Thi fadir comaundide to vs,
bifore that he diede, that we schulden seie to thee these thingis bi hise wordis; Y beseche, that thou foryete the wickidnesse of thi britheren, and the synne, and malice which thei hauntiden ayens thee; also we preien, that thou foryyue this wickidnesse to thi fadir, the seruaunt of God. Whanne these thingis weren herd, Joseph wepte.
And hise britheren camen to hym, and worschipiden lowe to erthe, and seiden, We ben thi seruauntis.
To whiche he answeride, Nyle ye drede; whether we moun ayenstonde Goddis wille?
Ye thouyten yuel of me, and God turnede it in to good, that he schulde enhaunse me, as ye seen in present tyme, and that he schulde make saaf many puplis;
nyle ye drede, Y schal fede you and youre litle children. And he coumfortide hem, and spak swetli, and liytly;
and he dwellide in Egipt, with al the hows of his fadir. And he lyuyde an hundrid yeer, and he seiy the sones of Effraym til to the thridde generacioun; also the sones of Machir, son of Manasses, weren borun in the knees of Joseph.
Whanne these thingis weren don, Joseph spak to hise brithren, Aftir my deeth God schal visite you, and he schal make to stie fro this lond to the loond which he swoor to Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob.
And whanne he hadde chargid hem, and hadde seid, God schal visite you, bere ye out with you my boonus fro this place,
he diede, whanne an hundrid and ten yeeris of his lijf weren fillid; and he was anoyntid with swete smellynge spiceries, and was kept in a beere in Egipt.

These ben the names of the sones of Israel, that entriden into Egipt with Jacob; alle entriden with her housis;
Ruben, Symeon,
Leuy, Judas, Isachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,
Dan, and Neptalim, Gad, and Aser.
Therfor alle the soules of hem that yeden out of `the hipe of Jacob weren seuenti and fyue.
Forsothe Joseph was in Egipt; and whanne he was deed, and alle hise brithren, and al his kynrede,
the sones of Israel encreessiden, and weren multiplied as buriounnyng, and thei weren maad strong greetli, and filliden the lond.
A newe kyng, that knewe not Joseph, roos in the meene tyme on Egipt, and seide to his puple, Lo!
the puple of the sones of Israel is myche, and strongere than we;
come ye, wiseli oppresse we it, lest perauenture it be multiplied; and lest, if batel risith ayens vs, it be addid to oure enemyes, and go out of the lond, whanne we ben ouercomun.
And so he made maistris of werkis souereyns to hem, that thei schulden turmente hem with chargis. And thei maden citees of tabernaclis to Farao, Fiton, and Ramesses.
And bi hou myche thei oppressiden hem, bi so myche thei weren multiplied, and encreessiden more.
And Egipcians hatiden the sones of Israel, and turmentiden, and scorneden hem;
and brouyten her lijf to bitternesse bi hard werkis of cley and to tijl stoon, and bi al seruage, bi which thei weren oppressid in the werkis of erthe.
Forsothe the kyng of Egipt seide to the mydwyues of Ebrews, of whiche oon was clepid Sefora, the tother Fua;
and he commaundide to hem, Whanne ye schulen do the office of medewyues to Ebrew wymmen, and the tyme of childberyng schal come, if it is a knaue child, sle ye him; if it is a womman, kepe ye.
Forsothe the medewyues dredden God, and diden not bi the comaundement of the kyng of Egipt, but kepten knaue children.
To whiche clepid to hym the kyng seide, What is this thing which ye wolden do, that ye wolden kepe the children?
Whiche answeriden, Ebrew wymmen ben not as the wymmen of Egipt, for thei han kunnyng of the craft of medewijf, and childen bifore that we comen to hem.
Therfor God dide wel to medewyues; and the puple encreesside, and was coumfortid greetli.
And for the mydewyues dredden God, he bildide `housis to hem.
Therfor Farao comaundide al his puple, and seide, What euer thing of male kynde is borun to Ebrewis, `caste ye into the flood; what euer thing of wymmen kynde, kepe ye.
Aftir these thingis a man of `the hows of Leuy yede out, and took a wijf of his kyn,
which conseyuede, and childide a sone. And sche seiy hym wel farynge, and hidde him bi thre monethis.
And whanne sche myyte not hele, thanne sche took a `leep of segge, and bawmede it with tar and pitch, and puttide the yong child with ynne, and puttide hym forth in a `place of spier of the brenke of the flood,
the while his sistir stood afer, and bihelde the bifalling of the thing.
Lo! forsothe the douytir of Farao cam doun to be waischun in the flood, and hir damysels walkiden bi the brenke of the flood. And whanne sche hadde seyn a leep in the `place of spier, sche sente oon of hir seruauntessis,
and sche openyde the leep brouyt to hir, and seiy a litil child wepynge ther ynne. And sche hadde mercy on the child, and seide, It is of the yonge children of Ebrews.
To whom the `sister of the child seide, Wolt thou that Y go, and clepe to thee an Ebrew womman, that may nurische the yong child?
She answeride, Go thou. The damysel yede, and clepide the `modir of the child.
To whom `the douytir of Farao spak, and seide, Take thou this child, and nurische to me; Y schal yyue to thee thi mede. The womman took, and nurischide the child, and bitook hym woxun to `the douytir of Farao,
whom sche purchaside `in to the place of sone; and sche clepide his name Moises, and seide, For Y took hym fro the watir.
In tho daies, aftir that Moises encreesside, he yede out to hise britheren, and seiy the turment of hem, and a man Egipcian smytynge `oon of Ebrews, hise britheren.
And whanne he hadde biholdun hidur and thidir, and hadde seyn, that no man was present, he killide the Egipcian, and hidde in soond.
And he yede out in another dai, and seiy tweyne Ebrews chidynge, and he seide to hym that dide wrong, Whi smytist thou thi brother?
Which answeride, Who ordeynede thee prince, ether iuge on vs? Whether thou wolt sle me, as thou killidist yisterdai the Egipcian? Moises dredde, and seide, Hou is this word maad opun?
And Farao herde this word, and souyte to sle Moyses, which fledde fro his siyt, and dwellide in the lond of Madian, and sat bisidis a pit.
Forsothe seuene douytris weren to the preest of Madian, that camen to drawe watir; and whanne the trouyis weren fillid, thei coueitiden to watere `the flockis of her fadir.
Scheepherdis camen aboue, and dreuen hem awei; and Moises roos, and defendide the dameselis; and he watride `the scheep of hem.
And whanne thei hadden turned ayen to Jetro, her fadir, he seide to hem, Whi camen ye swiftliere than ye weren wont?
Thei answeriden, A man of Egipt delyuerede vs fro the hond of scheepherdis; ferthermore and he drow watir with vs, and yaf drynk to the scheep.
And he seide, Where is that man? whi leften ye the man? clepe ye hym, that he ete breed.
Therfor Moises swoor, that he wolde dwelle with Jetro; and he took a wijf, Sefora, `the douyter of Jetro.
And sche childide a sone to hym, whom he clepide Gersan, and seide, Y was a comelyng in an alyen lond. Forsothe sche childide an othir sone, whom he clepide Eliezer, and seide, For God of my fadir is myn helpere, and delyuerede me fro the hond of Farao.
Forsothe aftir myche tyme the kyng of Egipt diede, and the sones of Israel inwardli weiliden for werkis, and crieden, and the cry of hem for werkis stiede to God.
And he herde the weilyng of hem, and he hadde mynde of the boond of pees, which he hadde maad with Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob; and he bihelde the sones of Israel,
and knewe hem.
Forsothe Moises kepte the scheep of Jetro, `his wyues fadir, preest of Madian; and whanne he hadde dryue the floc to the ynnere partis of deseert, he cam to Oreb, the hil of God.
Forsothe the Lord apperide to hym in the flawme of fier fro the myddis of the buysch, and he seiy that the buysch brente, and was not forbrent.
Therfor Moyses seide, Y schal go and schal se this greet siyt, whi the buysch is not forbrent.
Sotheli the Lord seiy that Moises yede to se, and he clepide Moises fro the myddis of the buysch, and seide, Moyses! Moises! Which answeride, Y am present.
And the Lord seide, Neiye thou not hidur, but vnbynde thou the scho of thi feet, for the place in which thou stondist is hooli lond.
And the Lord seide, Y am God of thi fadir, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. Moises hidde his face, for he durste not biholde ayens God.
To whom the Lord seide, Y seiy the affliccion of my puple in Egipt, and Y herde the cry therof, for the hardnesse of hem that ben souereyns of werkis.
And Y knew the sorewe of the puple, and Y cam down to delyuere it fro the hondis of Egipcians, and lede out of that lond in to a good lond and brood, into a lond that flowith with milk and hony, to the places of Cananey, and of Ethei, of Amorrey, and of Feresei, of Euey, and of Jebusei.
Therfor the cry of the sones of Israel cam to me, and Y seiy the turment of hem, bi which thei ben oppressid of Egipcians.
But come thou, I schal sende thee to Farao, that thou lede out my puple, the sones of Israel, fro Egipt.
And Moises seide to hym, Who am Y, that Y go to Farao, and lede out the sones of Israel fro Egipt?
And the Lord seide to Moises, Y schal be with thee, and thou schalt haue this signe, that Y haue sent thee, whanne thou hast led out my puple fro Egipt, thou schalt offre to God on this hil.
Moises seide to God, Lo! Y schal go to the sones of Israel, and Y schal seie to hem, God of youre fadris sente me to you; if thei schulen seie to me, what is his name, what schal Y seie to hem?
The Lord seide to Moises, Y am that am. The Lord seide, Thus thou schalt seie to the sones of Israel, He that is sente me to you.
And eft God seide to Moises, Thou schalt seie these thingis to the sones of Israel, The Lord God of youre fadris, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, sente me to you; this name is to me with outen ende, and this is my memorial in generacioun and in to generacioun.
Go thou, gadere thou the eldere men, that is, iugis, of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God of youre fadris apperide to me, God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob, and seide, Y visitynge haue visitid you, and Y seiy alle thingis that bifelden to you in Egipt;
and Y seide, that Y lede out you fro the affliccioun of Egipt in to the lond of Cananey, and of Ethei, and of Amorrei, and of Ferezei and of Euei, and of Jebusei, to the lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
And thei schulen here thi vois; and thou schalt entre, and the eldere men of Israel to the kyng of Egipt, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews clepide vs; we schulen go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, that we offre to oure Lord God.
But Y woot, that the kyng of Egipt schal not delyuere you that ye go, but bi strong hond;
for Y schal holde forthe myn hond, and I schal smyte Egipt in alle my marueils, whiche Y schal do in the myddis of hem; aftir these thingis he schal delyuere you.
And Y schal yyue grace to this puple bifore Egipcians, and whanne ye schulen go out, ye schulen not go out voide;
but a womman schal axe of hir neiyboresse and of her hoosteesse siluerne vesselis, and goldun, and clothis, and ye schulen putte tho on youre sones and douytris, and ye schulen make nakid Egipt.
Moyses answeride, and seide, The comyns schulen not bileue to me, nether thei schulen here my vois; but thei schulen seie, The Lord apperide not to thee.
Therfor the Lord seide to hym, What is this that thou holdist in thin hond? Moises answeride, A yerde.
And the Lord seide, Caste it forth into erthe; and he castide forth, and it was turned in to a serpent, so that Moises fledde.
And the Lord seide, Holde forth thin hond, and take the tail therof; he stretchide forth, and helde, and it was turned in to a yerde.
And the Lord seide, That thei bileue, that the Lord God of thi fadris apperide to thee, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
And the Lord seide eft, Putte thin hond in to thi bosum; and whanne he hadde put it in to the bosum, he brouyte forth it leprouse, at the licnesse of snow.
The Lord seide, Withdrawe thin hond in to thi bosum; he withdrow, and brouyte forth eft, and it was lijc the tother fleisch.
The Lord seide, If thei schulen not bileue to thee, nether schulen here the word of the formere signe, thei schulen bileue to the word of the signe suynge;
that if thei bileuen not sotheli to these twei signes, nether heren thi vois, take thou watir of the flood, and schedde out it on the drie lond, and what euer thing thou schalt drawe vp of the flood, it schal be turned in to blood.
Moises seide, Lord, Y biseche, Y am `not eloquent fro yistirdai and the thridde dai ago; and sithen thou hast spokun to thi seruaunt, Y am of more lettid and slowere tunge.
The Lord seide to hym, Who made the mouth of man, ether who made a doumb man and `deef, seynge and blynd? whether not Y?
Therfor go thou, and Y schal be in thi mouth, and Y schal teche thee what thou schalt speke.
And he seide, Lord, Y biseche, sende thou whom thou schalt sende.
And the Lord was wrooth ayens Moises, and seide, Y woot, that Aaron, thi brother, of the lynage of Leuy, is eloquent; lo! he schal go out in to thi comyng, and he schal se thee, and schal be glad in herte.
Speke thou to hym, and putte thou my wordis in his mouth, and Y schal be in thi mouth, and in the mouth of hym; and Y schal schewe to you what ye owen to do.
He schal speke for thee to the puple, and he schal be thi mouth; forsothe thou schalt be to him in these thingis, that perteynen to God.
Also take thou this yerde in thin hond, in which thou schalt do myraclis.
Moises yede, and turnede ayen to Jetro, his wyues fadir, and seide to hym, Y schal go, and turne ayen to my britheren in to Egipt, that Y se, whether thei lyuen yit. To whom Jetro seide, Go thou in pees.
Therfor the Lord seide to Moyses in Madian, Go thou, and turne ayen into Egipt; for alle thei ben deed that souyten thi lijf.
Moises took his wijf, and hise sones, and puttide hem on an asse, and he turnede ayen in to Egipt, and bar the yerde of God in his hond.
And the Lord seide to hym turnynge ayen in to Egipt, Se, that thou do alle wondris, whiche Y haue put in thin hond, bifore Farao; Y schal make hard his herte, and he schal not delyuere the puple; and thou schalt seie to hym,
The Lord seith these thingis, My firste gendrid sone is Israel;
Y seide to thee, delyuere thou my sone, that he serue me, and thou noldist delyuere hym; lo! Y schal sle thi firste gendrid sone.
And whanne Moises was in the weie, in an yn, the Lord cam to him, and wolde sle hym.
Sefora took anoon a moost scharp stoon, and circumcidide the yerde of hir sone; and sche towchide `the feet of Moises, and seide, Thou art an hosebonde of bloodis to me.
And he lefte hym, aftir that sche hadde seid, Thou art an hosebonde of bloodis to me for circumcisioun.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Aaron, Go thou in to the comyng of Moises in to deseert; which yede ayens Moises in to the hil of God, and kisside him.
And Moises telde to Aaron alle the wordis of the Lord, for whiche he hadde sent Moises; and `he telde the myraclis, whiche the Lord hadde comaundid.
And thei camen togidere, and gaderiden alle the eldere men of the sones of Israel.
And Aaron spak alle the wordis, whiche the Lord hadde seid to Moises, and he dide the signes bifore the puple;
and the puple bileuede; and thei herden, that the Lord hadde visitid the sones of Israel, and that he hadde biholde the turment of hem; and thei worschipiden lowe.
Aftir these thingis Moises and Aaron entriden, and seiden to Farao, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in deseert.
And he answeride, Who is the Lord, that Y here his vois, and delyuere Israel? I knowe not the Lord, and Y schal not delyuere Israel.
Thei seiden, God of Ebrews clepide vs, that we go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, and that we make sacrifice to oure Lord God, lest perauenture pestilence, ether swerd, bifalle to vs.
The kyng of Egipt seide to hem, Moises and Aaron, whi stiren ye the puple fro her werkis? Go ye to youre chargis.
And Farao seide, The puple of the loond is myche; ye seen that the cumpany hath encreessid; hou myche more schal it encreesse, if ye schulen yyue to hem reste fro werkis.
Therfor Farao comaundide in that dai to the maistris of werkis, and to rente gadereris of the puple,
and seide, Ye schulen no more yyue stre to the puple, to make tijl stoonys as bifore; but go thei, and gedere stobil;
and ye schulen sette on hem the mesure of tijl stoonys, which thei maden bifore, nether ye schulen abate ony thing; for thei ben idil, and therfor thei crien, and seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to oure God;
be thei oppressid bi werkis, and fille thei tho, that thei assente not to the false wordis.
Therfor the maistris of the workis and the rente gadereris yeden out to the puple, and seiden, Thus seith Farao, Y yyue not to you stre;
go ye, and gadere, if ye moun fynde ony where; nether ony thing schal be decreessid of youre werk.
And the puple was scaterid bi al the lond of Egipt to gadre stre.
And the maystris of werkis weren bisi, and seiden, Fille ye youre werk ech dai, as ye weren wont to do, whanne the stre was youun to you.
And thei, that weren maistris of the werkis of the sones of Israel, weren betun of the rent gadereris of Farao, that seiden, Whi filliden ye not the mesure of tijl stoonus, as bifore, nether yistirdai nethir to dai?
And the souereyns of the sonys of Israel camen, and crieden to Farao, and seiden, Whi doist thou so ayens thi seruauntis?
Stre is not youun to vs, and tijl stoonus ben comaundid in lijk manere. Lo! we thi seruauntis ben betun with scourgis, and it is doon vniustli ayens thi puple.
Farao seide, Ye yyuen tent to idilnesse, and therfor ye seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to the Lord;
therfor go ye, and worche; stre schal not be youun to you, and ye schulen yelde the customable noumbre of tijl stoonus.
And the souereyns of the children of Israel sien hem silf in yuel, for it was seid to hem, No thing schal be decreessid of tijl stoonus bi alle daies.
And thei `camen to Moises and Aaron, that stoden euene ayens, and thei `yeden out fro Farao,
and seiden to `Moises and Aaron, The Lord se, and deme, for ye han maad oure odour to stynke bifore Farao and hise seruauntis; and ye han youe to hym a swerd, that he schulde sle vs.
And Moises turnede ayen to the Lord, and seide, Lord, whi hast thou turmentid this puple? why sentist thou me?
For sithen Y entride to Farao, that Y schulde speke in thi name, thou hast turmentid thi puple, and hast not delyuered hem.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Now thou schalt se, what thingis Y schal do to Farao; for bi strong hond he schal delyuere hem, and in myyti hond he schal caste hem out of his lond.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Y am the Lord, that apperide to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob in Almyyti God; and Y schewide not to hem my greet name Adonai ;
and Y made couenaunt with hem, that Y schulde yyue to hem the lond of Canaan, the lond of her pilgrymage, in which thei weren comelyngis.
Y herde the weilyng of the sones of Israel, in which the Egipcians oppresseden hem, and Y hadde mynde of my couenaunt.
Therfor seie thou to the sones of Israel, Y am the Lord, that schal lede out you of the prisoun of Egipcians; and Y schal delyuere fro seruage; and Y schal ayen bie in `an hiy arm, and in grete domes;
and Y schal take you to me in to a puple, and Y schal be youre God; and ye schulen wite, for Y am youre Lord God, `which haue led you out of the prisoun of Egipcians,
and haue led you in to the lond, on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde yyue it to Abraham, and to Ysaac, and to Jacob; and Y schal yyue to you that lond to be weldid; I the Lord.
Therfor Moises telde alle thingis to the sones of Irael, whiche assentide not to hym for the angwisch of spirit, and for the hardest werk.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Entre thou, and speke to Farao, kyng of Egipt, that he delyuere the children of Israel fro his lond.
Moises answeride bifore the Lord, Lo! the children of Israel here not me, and hou schal Farao here, moost sithen Y am vncircumcidid in lippis?
And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron, and yaf comaundementis to the sones of Israel, and to Farao, kyng of Egipt, that thei schulden lede out the sones of Israel fro the lond of Egipt.
These ben the princis of housis bi her meynees. The sones of Ruben, the firste gendrid of Israel, Enoch, and Fallu, Esrom, and Charmy; these ben the kynredis of Ruben.
The sones of Symeon, Jamuel, and Jamyn, and Aod, and Jachym, and Soer, and Saul, the sone of a womman of Canaan; these ben the kynretis of Symeon.
And these ben the names of the sones of Leuy by her kynredis, Gerson, and Caath, and Merary. Forsothe the yeeris of lijf of Leuy weren an hundrid and seuene and thretti.
The sones of Gerson, Lobny and Semei, bi her kynredis.
The sones of Caath, Amram, and Isuar, and Hebron, and Oziel; and the yeeris of lijf of Caath weren an hundrid and thre and thretti.
The sones of Merari weren Mooli and Musi. These weren the kynredis of Leuy bi her meynees.
Forsothe Amram took a wijf, Jocabed, douytir of his fadris brother, and sche childide to hym Aaron, and Moises, and Marie; and the yeeris of lijf of Amram weren an hundred and seuene and thretti.
Also the sones of Isuar weren Chore, and Nafeg, and Zechry.
Also the sones of Oziel weren Misael, and Elisaphan, and Sechery.
Sotheli Aaron took a wijf, Elizabeth, the douytir of Amynadab, the sistir of Naason, and sche childide to hym Nadab, and Abyu, and Eleazar, and Ythamar.
Also the sones of Chore weren Aser, and Elcana, and Abiasab; thes weren the kinredis of Chore.
And sotheli Eleazar, sone of Aaron, took a wijf of the douytris of Phatiel, and sche childide Fynees to hym. These ben the princis of the meynees of Leuy bi her kynredis.
This is Aaron and Moises, to whiche the Lord comaundide, that thei schulden lede out of the lond of Egipt the sones of Israel by her cumpanyes;
these it ben, that speken to Pharao king of Egipt, that thei lede the sones of Israel out of Egipt;
this is Moises and Aaron, in the dai in which the Lord spak to Moises in the lond of Egipt.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Y am the Lord; spek thou to Farao, kyng of Egipt, alle thingis whiche Y speke to thee.
And Moises seide bifore the Lord, Lo! Y am vncircumcidid in lippis; hou schal Farao here me?
And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! Y haue maad thee the god of Farao; and Aaron, thi brother, schal be thi prophete.
Thou schalt speke to Aaron alle thingis whiche Y comaunde to thee, and he schal speke to Farao, that he delyuere the sones of Israel fro his hond.
But Y schal make hard his herte, and Y schal multiplie my signes and merueils in the lond of Egipt, and he schal not here you;
and Y schal sende myn hond on Egipt, and Y schal lede out myn oost, and my puple, the sones of Israel, fro the lond of Egipt bi mooste domes;
and Egipcians schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, which haue holde forth myn hond on Egipt, and haue led out of the myddis of hem the sones of Israel.
And so Moises dide and Aaron; as the Lord comaundide, so thei diden.
Forsothe Moyses was of fourescoor yeer, and Aaron was of fourescoor yeer and thre, whanne thei spaken to Farao.
And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron,
Whanne Farao schal seie to you, Schewe ye signes to vs, thou schalt seie to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and caste forth it before Farao, and be it turned into a serpent.
And so Moises and Aaron entriden to Farao, and diden as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron took the yeerde, and castide forth bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which yerde was turned in to a serpent.
Forsothe Farao clepide wise men, and witchis, and thei also diden bi enchauntementis of Egipt, and bi summe priuy thingis in lijk maner;
and alle castiden forth her yerdis, whiche weren turned in to dragouns; but the yerde of Aaron deuouride `the yerdis of hem.
And the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moyses, The herte of Farao is maad greuouse, he nyle delyuere the puple;
go thou to hym eerli; lo! he schal go out to the watris, and thou schalt stonde in the comyng of hym on the brynke of the flood; and thou schalt take in thin honde the yerde, that was turned into a dragoun,
and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews sente me to thee, and seide, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in desert; til to present time thou noldist here.
Therfor the Lord seith these thingis, In this thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord; lo! Y schal smyte with the yerde, which is in myn hond, the watir of the flood, and it schal be turned in to blood;
and the fischis that ben in the flood schulen die; and the watris schulen wexe rotun, and Egipcians drynkynge the watir of the flood schulen be turmentid.
Also the Lord seide to Moises, Seie thou to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and holde forth thin hond on the watris of Egipt, and on the flodis of hem, and on the stremys `of hem, and on the mareis, and alle lakis of watris, that tho be turned in to blood; and blood be in al the lond of Egipt, as wel in vessils of tree as of stoon.
And Moises and Aaron diden so, as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron reiside the yerde, and smoot the watir of the flood bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which watir was turned in to blood;
and fischis, that weren in the flood, dieden; and the flood was rotun, and Egipcians myyten not drynke the water of the flood; and blood was in al the lond of Egipt.
And the witchis of Egipcians diden in lijk maner by her enchauntementis; and the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
And he turnede awei hym silf, and entride in to his hows, nethir he took it to herte, yhe, in this tyme.
Forsothe alle Egipcians diggiden watir `bi the cumpas of the flood, to drinke; for thei myyten not drynke of the `watir of the flood.
And seuene daies weren fillid, aftir that the Lord smoot the flood.
Also the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; sotheli if thou nylt delyuere, lo!
Y schal smyte alle thi termys with paddoks;
and the flood schal buyle out paddokis, that schulen stie, and schulen entre in to thin hows, and in to the closet of thi bed, and on thi bed, and in to `the hous of thi seruauntis, and in to thi puple, and in to thin ouenes, and in to the relyues of thi metis;
and the paddoks schulen entre to thee, and to thi puple, and to alle thi seruauntis.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Seie thou to Aaron, Hold forth thin hond on the floodis, and on the streemes, and mareis; and bryng out paddoks on the lond of Egipt.
And Aaron helde forth the hond on the watris of Egipt; and paddoks stieden, and hileden the lond of Egipt.
Forsothe and the witchis diden in lijk maner bi her enchauntementis; and thei brouyten forth paddoks on the lond of Egipt.
Forsothe Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Preie ye the Lord, that he do a wei the paddoks fro me, and fro my puple; and Y schal delyuere the puple, that it make sacrifice to the Lord.
And Moises seide to Farao, Ordeyne thou a tyme to me, whanne Y schal preie for thee, and for thi seruauntis, and for thi puple, that the paddokis be dryuun awei fro thee, and fro thin hows, and fro thi seruauntis, and fro thi puple; and dwelle oneli in the flood.
And he answeride, To morewe. And Moises seide, Y schal do bi thi word, that thou wite, that noon is as oure Lord God; and the paddoks schulen go awei fro thee,
and fro thin hous, and fro thi children, and fro thi seruauntis, and fro thi puple; and tho schulen dwelle oneli in the flood.
And Moises and Aaron yeden out fro Farao. And Moises criede to the Lord, for the biheest of paddoks, which he hadde seid to Farao.
And the Lord dide bi the word of Moises; and the paddoks weren deed fro housis, and fro townes, and fro feeldis;
and thei gaderiden tho in to grete heepis, and the lond was rotun.
Sotheli Farao seiy that reste was youun, and he made greuous his herte, and herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Spek thou to Aaron, Holde forth thi yerde, and smyte the dust of erthe, and litle flies, ether gnattis, be in al the lond of Egipt.
And thei diden so; and Aaron helde forth the hond, and helde the yerde, and smoot the duste of erthe; and gnattis weren maad in men, and in werk beestis; al the dust of erthe was turned in to gnattis bi al the lond of Egipt.
And witchis diden in lijk maner bi her enchauntementis, that thei schulden brynge forth gnattis, and thei miyten not; and gnattis weren as wel in men as in werk beestis.
And the witchis seiden to Farao, This is the fyngur of God. And the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Rise thou eerli, and stonde bifore Farao, for he schal go out to the watris; and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me;
that if thou schalt not delyuere the puple, lo! Y schal sende in to thee, and in to thi seruauntis, and in to thi puple, and in to thin housis, al the kynde of flies ; and the housis of Egipcians schulen be fillid with flies of dyuerse kyndis, and al the lond in which thei schulen be.
And in that dai Y schal make wondurful the lond of Gessen, in which my puple is, that flies be not there; and that thou wite that Y am the Lord in the myddis of erthe;
and Y schal sette departyng bitwixe my puple and thi puple; this signe schal be to morewe.
And the Lord dide so. And a moost greuouse flie cam in to the hows of Farao, and of hise seruauntis, and in to al the lond of Egipt; and the lond was corrupt of siche flies.
And Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Go ye, make ye sacrifice to `youre Lord God in this lond.
And Moises seide, It may not be so, for `we schulen offre to oure God the abhomynaciouns of Egipcians; that if we schulen sle bifore Egipcians tho thingis whiche thei worschipen, thei schulen `ouerleie vs with stoonus.
We schulen go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, and we schulen make sacrifice to oure Lord God, as he comaundide vs.
And Farao seide, Y schal delyuere you, that ye make sacrifice to `youre Lord God in deseert; netheles go ye not ferthere; preie ye for me.
And Moises seide, Y schal go out fro thee, and Y schal preie the Lord; and the fli schal go awei fro Farao, and fro hise seruauntis, and puple to morewe; netheles nyle thou more disseyue me, that thou delyuere not the puple to make sacrifice to the Lord.
And Moises yede out fro Farao, and preiede the Lord, whiche dide bi the word of Moyses,
and took awei flies fro Farao, and fro hise seruauntis, and puple; noon lefte, `sotheli nether oon.
And the herte of Farao was maad hard, so that he delyueride not the puple, sothli nethir in this tyme.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, and speke thou to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me;
that if thou forsakist yit, and withholdist hem, lo!
myn hond schal be on thi feeldis, on horsis, and assis, and camels, and oxun, and scheep, a pestilence ful greuous;
and the Lord schal make a merueilous thing bitwixe the possessiouns of Israel and the possessiouns of Egipcians, that outirli no thing perische of these thingis that perteynen to the sones of Israel.
And the Lord ordeinede a tyme, and seide, To morewe the Lord schal do this word in the lond.
Therfor the Lord made this word in the tother dai, and alle the lyuynge beestis of Egipcians weren deed; forsothe outirli no thing perischide of the beestis of the sones of Israel.
And Farao sente to se, nether ony thing was deed of these thingis whiche Israel weldide; and the herte of Farao was maad greuouse, and he delyuerede not the puple.
And the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron, Take ye the hondis ful of askis of the chymeney, and Moises sprynge it in to heuene bifore Farao;
and be there dust on al the lond of Egipt; for whi botchis schulen be in men and in werk beestis, and bolnynge bladdris schulen be in al the lond of Egipt.
And thei token askis of the chymney, and stoden bifore Farao; and Moises spreynt it into heuene; and woundis of bolnynge bladdris weren maad in men, and in werk beestis;
and the witchis myyten not stonde bifor Moises, for woundis that weren in hem, and in al the lond of Egipt.
And the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he herde not hem, as the Lord spak to Moises.
Also the Lord seide to Moises, Rise thou eerli, and stonde bifore Farao, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seth these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me;
for in this tyme Y schal sende alle my veniauncis on thin herte, and on thi seruauntis, and on thi puple, that thou wite, that noon is lijk me in al erthe.
For now Y schal holde forth the hond, and Y schal smyte thee and thi puple with pestilence, and thou schalt perische fro erthe;
forsothe herfor Y haue set thee, that Y schewe my strengthe in thee, and that my name be teld in ech lond.
Yit thou withholdist my puple, and nylt delyuere it?
Lo! to morewe in this same our Y schal reyne ful myche hail, which maner hail was not in Egipt, fro the dai in which it was foundid, til in to present tyme.
Therfor sende thou `riyt now, and gadere thi werk beestis, and alle thingis whiche thou hast in the feeld; for men and werk beestis and alle thingis that ben in feeldis with outforth, and ben not gaderid fro the feeldis, and haile falle on tho, schulen die.
He that dredde `the Lordis word, of the seruauntis of Farao, made his seruauntis and werk beestis fle in to housis;
sotheli he that dispiside the `Lordis word, lefte his seruauntis and werk beestis in the feeldis.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond in to heuene, that hail be maad in al the lond of Egipt, on men, and on werk beestis, and on ech eerbe of the feeld in the lond of Egipt.
And Moises held forth the yerde in to heuene; and the Lord yaf thundris, and hail, and leitis rennynge aboute on the lond; and the Lord reynede hail on the lond of Egipt;
and hail and fier meddlid togidere weren borun forth; and it was of so myche greetnesse, how greet apperide neuere bifore in al the lond of Egipt, sithen thilke puple was maad.
And the hail smoot in the lond of Egipt alle thingis that weren in the feeldis, fro man til to werk beeste; and the hail smoot al the eerbe of the feeld, and brak al the flex of the cuntrey;
oonli the hail felde not in the lond of Gessen, where the sones of Israel weren.
And Farao sente, and clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Y haue synned also now; the Lord is iust, Y and my puple ben wickid;
preye ye the Lord, that the thundris and hail of God ceesse, and Y schal delyuere you, and dwelle ye no more here.
Moyses seide, Whanne Y schal go out of the citee, Y schal holde forth myn hondis to the Lord, and leitis and thundris schulen ceesse, and hail schal not be, that thou wite, that the lond is the Lordis;
forsothe Y knowe, that thou and thi seruauntis dreden not yit the Lord.
Therfor the flex and barli was hirt, for the barli was greene, and the flex hadde buriounned thanne knoppis;
forsothe wheete and beenys weren not hirt, for tho weren late.
And Moyses yede out fro Farao, and fro the citee, and helde forth the hondis to the Lord, and thundris and hail ceessiden, and reyn droppide no more on the erthe.
Sotheli Farao siy that the reyn hadde ceessid, and the hail, and thundris, and he encreesside synne;
and the herte of hym and of hise seruauntis was maad greuouse, and his herte was maad hard greetli; nethir he lefte the sones of Israel, as the Lord comaundide bi `the hond of Moises.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, for Y haue maad hard the herte of hym, and of hise seruauntis, that Y do these signes `of me in hym;
and that thou telle in the eeris of thi sone and of `thi sones sones, how ofte Y al to-brak Egipcians, and dide signes in hem; and that ye wyte that Y am the Lord.
Therfore Moises and Aaron entriden to Farao, and seiden to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seith these thingis, How long `nylt thou be maad suget to me? Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; ellis sotheli if thou ayenstondist,
and nylt delyuere it, lo! Y schal brynge in to morewe a locuste in to thi coostis,
which schal hile the hiyere part of erthe, nether ony thing therof schal appere, but that, that was `residue to the hail schal be etun; for it schal gnawe alle the trees that buriounnen in feeldis;
and tho schulen fille thin howsis, and the howsis of thi seruauntis, and of alle Egipcians, hou greet thi fadris and grauntsiris sien not, sithen thei weren borun on erthe, til in to present dai. And Moises turnede awei hym silf, and yede out fro Farao.
Forsothe the seruauntis of Farao seiden to hym, Hou longe schulen we suffre this sclaundre? Delyuere the men, that thei make sacrifice to `her Lord God; seest thou not that Egipt perischide?
And thei ayen clepiden Moises and Aaron to Farao, and he seide to hem, Go ye, and make ye sacrifice to `youre Lord God; whiche ben thei, that schulen go?
Moises seide, We schulen go with oure litle children and eldre, and with sones, and douytris, with scheep, and grete beestis; for it is the solempnyte of `oure Lord God.
And Farao answeride, So the Lord be with you ; hou therfor schal Y delyuere you and youre litle children? to whom is it doute, that ye thenken worst?
It schal `not be so; but go ye men oneli, and make ye sacrifice to the Lord; for also ye axiden this. And anoon thei weren cast out fro the siyt of Farao.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thi hond on the lond of Egipt, to a locust, that it stie on the lond, and deuoure al the eerbe which is residue to the hail.
And Moises helde forthe the yerde on the lond of Egipt, and the Lord brouyte in a brennynge wynd al that dai and niyt; and whanne the morewtid was maad, the brennynge wynd reiside locustis, whiche stieden on al the lond of Egipt,
and saten in alle the coostis of Egipcians; `and the locustis weren vnnoumbrable, and suche weren not bifore that tyme, nether schulen come aftirward.
And tho hiliden al the face of the erthe, and wastiden alle thingis; therfor the eerbe of the erthe was deuourid, and what euere of applis was in trees, whiche the hail hadde left, `it was deuourid; and outirli no green thing was left in trees and in eerbis of erthe, in al Egipt.
Wherfor Farao hastide, and clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Y haue synned ayens youre Lord God, and ayens yow;
but now foryyue ye the synne to me; also in this tyme preie ye youre Lord God, that he take awey fro me this deeth.
And Moises yede out of the siyt of Farao, and preiede the Lord;
which made a moost strong wynd to blowe fro the west, and took, and castide the locust in to the reed see; `noon dwellide, sotheli nether oon, in alle the coostis of Egipt.
And the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he lefte not the sones of Israel.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond in to heuene, and derknessis be on the lond of Egipt, so thicke that tho moun be gropid.
And Moises helde forth the hond in to heuene, and orrible derknessis weren maad in al the lond of Egipt;
in thre daies no man seiy his brother, nether mouede him silf fro that place in which he was. Whereuer the sones of Israel dwelliden, liyt was.
And Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Go ye, make ye sacrifice to the Lord; oneli youre scheep and grete beestis dwelle stille; youre litle children go with you.
Moises seide, Also thou schalt yyue to vs offryngis and brent sacrifices, whiche we schulen offre to `oure Lord God;
alle the flockis schulen go with vs, for `a cle schal not dwelle of tho thingis, that ben nedeful in to the worschipyng of `oure Lord God, moost sithen we witen not what owith to be offrid, til we comen to that place.
Forsothe the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he nolde delyuere hem.
And Farao seide to Moises, Go awei fro me, and be war that thou se no more my face; in whateuer dai thou schalt appere to me, thou schalt die.
Moyses answeride, Be it doon so, as thou hast spokun; I schal no more se thi face.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Yit Y schal touche Farao and Egipt with o veniaunce, and after these thingis he schal delyuere you, and schal constreyne you to go out.
Therfor thou schalt seie to al the puple, that a man axe of his freend, and a womman of hir neiyboresse, silueren vessels and goldun, and clothis;
forsothe the Lord schal yyue grace to his puple bifor Egipcians. And Moises was a ful greet man in the lond of Egipt, bifore the seruauntis of Farao and al the puple;
and he seide, The Lord seith these thingis, At mydnyyt Y schal entre in to Egipt;
and ech firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipcians schal die, fro the firste gendrid of Farao, that sittith in the trone of hym, til to the firste gendrid of the handmayde, which is at the querne; and alle the firste gendrid of beestis schulen die;
and greet cry schal be in al the lond of Egipt, which maner cry was not bifore, nether schal be aftirward.
Forsothe at alle the children of Israel a dogge schal not make priuy noise, fro man til to beeste; that ye wite bi how greet myracle the Lord departith Egipcians and Israel.
And alle these thi seruauntis schulen come doun to me, and thei schulen preye me, and schulen seie, Go out thou, and al the puple which is suget to thee; aftir these thingis we schulen go out.
And Moyses was ful wrooth, and yede out fro Farao. Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Farao schal not here you, that many signes be maad in the lond of Egipt.
Sotheli Moises and Aaron maden alle signes and wondris, that ben writun, bifor Farao; and the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, nether he delyuerede the sones of Israel fro his lond.
Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron in the lond of Egipt,
This monethe, the bigynnyng of monethis to you, schal be the firste in the monethis of the yeer.
Speke ye to al the cumpanye of the sones of Israel, and seie ye to hem, In the tenthe dai of this monethe ech man take a lomb by hise meynees and housis;
but if the noumbre is lesse, that it may not suffice to ete the lomb, he schal take his neiybore, which is ioyned to his hows, bi the noumbre of soulis, that moun suffice to the etyng of the lomb.
Forsothe the lomb schal be a male of o yeer, without wem; bi which custom ye schulen take also a kide ;
and ye schulen kepe hym til to the fouretenthe dai of this monethe; and al the multitude of the sones of Israel schal offre hym at euentid.
And thei schulen take of his blood, and schulen put on euer either post, and in lyntels, `ether hiyer threschfoldis, of the housis, in whiche thei schulen ete hym;
and in that niyt thei schulen ete fleischis, roostid with fier, and therf looues, with letusis of the feeld.
Ye schulen not ete therof ony raw thing, nether sodun in watir, but roostid oneli by fier; ye schulen deuoure the heed with feet and entrailis therof;
nether ony thing therof schal abide til the morewtid; if ony thing is residue, ye schulen brenne in the fier.
Forsothe thus ye schulen ete hym; ye schulen girde youre reynes, and ye schulen haue schoon in the feet, and ye schulen holde stauys in hondis, and ye schulen ete hastili; for it is fase, that is, the passyng of the Lord.
And Y schal passe thorou the lond of Egipt in that niyt, and Y schal smyte al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro man til to beeste; and Y the Lord schal make domes in alle the goddis of Egipt.
Forsothe blood schal be to you in to signe, in the housis in whiche ye schulen be; and Y schal se the blood, and Y schal passe you; nether a wounde distriynge schal be in you, whanne Y schal smyte the lond of Egipt.
Forsothe ye schulen haue this dai in to mynde, and `ye schulen make it solempne to the Lord in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge worschipyng.
In seuene daies ye schulen ete therf breed; in the firste dai no thing diyt with sour douy schal be in youre housis; who euer schal ete ony thing diyt with sour douy, fro the firste dai til the seuenthe dai, that soule schal perische fro Israel.
The firste day schal be hooli and solempne, and the seuenthe dai schal be worschipful bi the same halewyng; ye schulen not do ony werk in tho daies, outakun these thingis that perteynen to mete;
and ye schulen kepe therf breed. For in that same dai Y schal lede out of the lond of Egipt youre oost; and ye schulen kepe this dai in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge custom.
In the first monethe, in the fouretenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, ye schulen ete therf breed, til to the oon and twentithe dai of the same monethe at euentid.
In seuene dayes no thing `diyt with sour douy schal be foundun in youre housis; if ony etith ony thing diyt with sour dow, his soule schal perische fro the cumpeny of Israel, as wel of comelyngis, as of hem that ben borun in the lond.
Ye schulen not ete ony thing diyt with sour dow, and ye schulen ete therf breed in alle youre dwellyng placis.
Forsothe Moises clepide alle the eldre men of the sones of Israel, and seide to hem, Go ye, and take a beeste by youre meynees, and offre ye fase; and dippe ye a bundel of isope,
in the blood which `is in the threisfold, and sprynge ye therof the lyntel, and euer either post; noon of you schal go out at the dore of his hows til the morewtid.
For the Lord schal passe smytynge Egipcians; and whanne he schal se the blood in the lyntel, and in euer either post, he schal passe the dore of the hows; and he schal not suffre the smytere to entre in to youre housis, and to hirte.
Kepe thou this word; it schal be a lawful thing to thee and to thi sones til in to with outen ende.
And whanne ye schulen entre in to the lond which the Lord schal yyue to you, as he bihiyte, ye schulen kepe these cerymonyes;
and whanne youre sones schulen seie to you, What is this religioun? ye schulen seie to hem,
It is the sacrifice of the passyng of the Lord, whanne he passide ouer the housis of the sones of Israel in Egipt, and smoot Egipcians, and delyueride oure housis. And the puple was bowid, and worschipide.
And the sones of Israel yeden out, and diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and to Aaron.
Forsothe it was doon in the myddis of the nyyt, the Lord smoot al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the firste gendrid of Farao, that sat in the trone of hym, til to the first gendrid of the caitif womman, that was in the prisoun, and alle the first gendrid of beestis.
And Farao roos in the nyyt, and alle hise seruauntis, and al Egipt; and a greet cry was maad in Egipt, for noon hows was, in which a deed man lay not.
And whanne Moises and Aaron weren clepid in the nyyt, Farao seide, Rise ye, go ye out fro my puple, bothe ye and the sones of Israel; go ye, offre ye to the Lord, as ye seien;
take ye youre scheep and greete beestis, as ye axiden; and go ye, and blesse ye me.
And Egipcians constreyneden the puple to go out of the lond swiftli, and seiden, All we schulen die!
Therfor the puple took meele spreynd togidere, bifor that it was diyt with sour douy; and boond in mentils, and puttide on her schuldris.
And the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises; and thei axiden of Egipcians siluerne vesselis and goldun, and ful myche clooth.
Forsothe the Lord yaf grace to the puple bifor Egipcians, that the Egipcians lenten to hem; and thei maden bare Egipcians.
And the sones of Israel yeden forth fro Ramasses in to Socoth, almest sixe hundrid thousind of foot men, with out litle children and wymmen;
but also comyn puple of malis and femalis vnnoumbrable stieden with hem; scheep, and oxun, and ful many beestis of diuerse kynde, stieden with hem.
And thei bakiden meele, which spreynd to gidere `a while ago thei token fro Egipt, and maden therf looues bakun vnder the aischis; for the looues miyten not be diyt with sour dow, for Egipcians compelliden to go out, and suffriden not to make ony tariyng, nether it was leiser to make ony seew.
Forsothe the dwellyng of the sones of Israel, bi which thei dwelliden in Egipt, was of foure hundrid and thretti yeer ;
and whanne tho weren fillid, al the oost of the Lord yede out of the lond of Egipt in the same dai.
This nyyt is worthi to be kept in the worschipyng of the Lord, whanne he ladde hem out of the lond of Egipt; alle the sones of Israel owen to kepe this in her generaciouns.
Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron, This is the religioun of fase; ech alien schal not ete therof;
sotheli ech seruaunt bouyt schal be circumcidid, and so he schal ete;
a comelyng and hirid man schulen not ete therof;
it schal be etun in oon hows; nether ye schulen bere out of the fleischis therof; nether ye schulen breke a boon therof.
Ech company of the sones of Israel schal make that fase;
that if ony pilgrym wole passe into youre feith and worschipyng, and make fase of the Lord, ech male kynde of hym schal be circumcidid bifore, and thanne he schal make lawfuli, and he schal be to gidere as a man borun of the lond; forsothe if ony man is not circumcidid, he schal not ete therof.
The same lawe schal be to a man borun of the lond, and to a comelyng, that takith youre feith, which is a pilgrym anentis you.
And alle the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and Aaron.
And in the same dai the Lord ladde out of `the lond of Egipt the sones of Israel, bi her cumpanies.
Also the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Halewe thou to me ech firste gendrid thing that openeth the wombe among the sones of Israel, as wel of men as of beestis, for whi alle ben myn.
And Moises seide to the puple, Haue ye mynde of this dai, in which ye yeden out of Egipt, and of the hows of seruage, for in strong hond the Lord ledde you out of this place, that ye ete not breed diyt with sour dow.
To dai ye gon out, in the monethe of new fruytis;
and whanne the Lord hath led thee in to the lond of Cananey, and of Ethei, and of Amorrei, and of Euei, and of Jebusei, which lond he swoor to thi fadris, that he schulde yyue to thee, a lond flowynge with mylk and hony, thou schalt halowe this custom of holy thingis in this monethe.
In seuene daies thou schalt ete therf looues, and the solempnete of the Lord schal be in the seuenthe dai;
ye schulen ete therf looues seuene daies, no thing diyt with sour dow schal appere at thee, nether in alle thi coostis.
And thou schalt telle to thi sone in that dai, and schalt seie, This it is that the Lord dide to me, whanne Y yede out of Egipt.
And it schal be as a signe in thin hond, and as a memorial before thin iyen, and that the lawe of the Lord be euere in thi mouth; for in a strong hond the Lord ledde thee out of Egipt, and of the hows of seruage.
Thou schalt kepe siche a worschipyng in tyme ordeined, `fro daies in to daies.
And whanne the Lord hath brouyt thee in to the lond of Cananey, as he swoor to thee, and to thi fadris, and hath youe it to thee,
thou schalt departe to the Lord al the thing that openeth the wombe, and that that is the firste in thi beestis; what euer thing thou hast of male kynde, thou schalt halewe to the Lord.
Thou schalt chaunge the firste gendrid of an asse for a scheep, that if thou ayen biest not, thou schalt sle; forsothe thou schalt ayen bie with prijs al the firste gendrid of man of thi sones.
And whanne thi sone schal axe thee to morewe, and seie, What is this? thou schalt answere to hym, In a strong hond the Lord ladde vs out of the lond of Egipt, of the hows of seruage; for whanne Farao was maad hard,
and nolde delyuere vs, the Lord killide alle the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the firste gendrid of man til to the firste gendrid of beestis; therfor Y offre to the Lord al thing of male kynde that openeth the wombe, and Y ayen bie alle the firste gendrid thingis of my sones.
Therfor it schal be as a signe in thin hond, and as a thing hangid for mynde bifore thin iyen, for in a strong hond the Lord ledde vs out of Egipt.
Therfor whanne Farao hadde sent out the puple, God ledde not hem out bi the weie of `the lond of Filisteis, which is niy; and arettid lest perauenture it wolde repente the puple, if he had seyn batelis rise ayens hym, and `the puple wolde turn ayen in to Egipt;
but God ledde aboute by the weie of deseert, which weie is bisidis the reed see. And the sones of Israel weren armed, and stieden fro the lond of Egipte.
And Moises took the boonus of Joseph with hym, for he hadde chargid the sones of Israel, and hadde seid, God schal visite you, and bere ye out `fro hennus my boonus with you.
And thei yeden forth fro Socoth, and settiden tentis in Etham, in the laste endis of wildirnesse.
Forsothe the Lord yede bifore hem to schewe the weie, bi dai in a piler of clowde, and bi nyyt in a piler of fier, that he schulde be ledere of the weie in euer either time;
the piler of clowde failide neuere bi dai, nether the piler of fier bi niyt, bifor the puple.
Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel;
turne thei ayen, and sette thei tentis euene ayens Fiayroth, which is bitwixe Magdalum and the see, ayens Beelsefon; in the siyt therof ye schulen sette tentis ouer the see.
And Farao schal seie on the sones of Israel, Thei ben maad streit in the lond, the deseert hath closid hem to gidere.
And Y schal make hard his herte, and he schal pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al his oost; and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord; and thei diden so.
And it was teld to the kyng of Egipcians, that the puple hadde fled; and the herte of Farao and of hise seruauntis was chaungid on the puple, and thei seiden, What wolden we do, that we leften Israel, that it schulde not serue us?
Therfor Farao ioynede the chare, and took with him al his puple;
and he took sixe hundrid chosyn charis, and what euer thing of charis was in Egipt, and duykis of al the oost.
And the Lord made hard `the herte of Farao, kyng of Egipt, and he pursuede the sones of Israel; and thei weren go out in an hiy hond.
And whanne Egipcians pursueden the steppis of the sones of Israel bifor goynge, thei founden hem in tentis on the see; al the chyualrye and charis of Farao, and al the oost weren in Fiayroth, ayens Beelsefon.
And whanne Farao hadde neiyed the sones of Israel, reisiden her iyen, and thei sien Egipcians bihynde hem, and dredden greetli; and thei crieden to the Lord,
and seiden to Moises, In hap sepulcris weren not in Egipt, therfor thou hast take vs awei, that we schulen die in wildirnesse? what woldist thou do this, that thou leddist vs out of Egipt?
Whether this is not the word which we spaken to thee in Egipt, `and seiden, Go awei fro vs, that we serue Egipcians? for it is myche betere to serue hem, than to die in wildirnesse.
And Moises seide to the puple, Nyle ye drede, stonde ye, and `se ye the grete werkys of God, whiche he schal do to dai; for ye schulen no more se Egipcians, whiche ye seen now, til in to with outen ende;
the Lord schal fiyte for you, and ye schulen be stille.
And the Lord seide to Moises, What criest thou to me? Speke thou to the sones of Israel, that thei go forth; forsothe reise thou thi yerde,
and stretche forth thin hond on the see, and departe thou it, that the sones of Israel go in the myddis of the see, by drie place.
Forsothe Y schal make hard the herte of Egipcians, that thei pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al the oost of hym, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym;
and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord God, whanne Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym.
And the aungel of the Lord, that yede bifore the castellis of Israel, took hym silf, and yede bihynde hem; and the piler of cloude yede to gidir with hym, and lefte the formere thingis aftir the bak,
and stood bitwixe the `castels of Egipcians and castels of Israel; and the cloude was derk toward Egipcians, and liytnynge `the nyyt toward `the children of Israel, so that in al the tyme of the niyt thei miyten not neiy togidere to hem silf.
And whanne Moises hadde stretchid forth the hond on the see, the Lord took it awei, the while a greet wynde and brennynge blew in al the niyt, and turnede in to dryenesse; and the watir was departid.
And the sones of Israel entriden by the myddis of the drye see; for the watir was as a wal at the riyt side and left side of hem.
And Egipcians pursueden, and entriden aftir hem, al the ridyng of Farao, hise charis, and knyytis, bi the myddis of the see.
And the wakyng of the morewtid cam thanne, and lo! the Lord bihelde on the castels of Egipcians, bi a piler of fier, and of cloude, and killide the oost of hem; and he destriede the wheelis of charis,
and tho weren borun in to the depthe. Therfor Egipcians seiden, Fle we Israel; for the Lord fiytith for hem ayenus vs.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond on the see, that the watris turne ayen to Egipcians, on the charis, and knyytis of hem.
And whanne Moises hadde hold forth the hoond ayens the see, it turnede ayen first in the morewtid to the formere place; and whanne Egipcians fledden, the watris camen ayen, and the Lord wlappide hem in the myddis of the floodis.
And the watris turneden ayen, and hiliden the charis, and knyytis of al the oost of Farao, which sueden, and entriden in to the see; sotheli not oon of hem was alyue.
Forsothe the sones of Israel yeden thorouy the myddis of the drye see, and the watris weren to hem as for a wal, on the riyt side and left side.
And in that dai the Lord delyuerede Israel fro the hond of Egipcians, and thei sien Egipcians deed on the brynke of the see,
and thei seiyen the greet hond which the Lord hadde vsid ayens hem; and the puple dredde the Lord, and thei bileueden to the Lord, and to Moises his seruaunt.
Thanne Moises song, and the sones of Israel, this song to the Lord; and thei seiden, Synge we to the Lord, for he is magnefied gloriousli; he castide doun the hors and the stiere in to the see.
My strengthe and my preisyng is the Lord; and he is maad to me in to heelthe. This is my God, and Y schal glorifie hym; the God of my fadir, and Y schal enhaunse hym.
The Lord is as a man fiyter, his name is Almiyti;
he castide doun in to the see the charis of Farao, and his oost. Hise chosun princis weren drenchid in the reed see;
the depe watris hiliden hem; thei yeden doun in to the depthe as a stoon.
Lord, thi riythond is magnyfied in strengthe; Lord, thi riythond smoot the enemye.
And in the mychilnesse of thi glorie thou hast put doun alle myn aduersaries; thou sentist thin ire, that deuouride hem as stobil.
And watris weren gaderid in the spirit of thi woodnesse; flowinge watir stood, depe watris weren gaderid in the middis of the see.
The enemy seide, Y schal pursue, and Y schal take; Y schal departe spuylis, my soule schal be fillid. I schal drawe out my swerde; myn hond schal sle hem.
Thi spirit blew, and the see hilide hem; thei weren drenchid as leed in grete watris.
Lord, who is lijk thee in stronge men, who is lijk thee? thou art greet doere in hoolynesse; ferdful, and preisable, and doynge myraclis.
Thou heldist forth thin hond, and the erthe deuouride hem;
thou were ledere in thi merci to thy puple, which thou ayen bouytist; and thou hast bore hym in thi strengthe to thin holi dwellyng place.
Puplis stieden, and weren wroothe; sorewis helden the dwelleris of Filistiym.
Thanne the pryncis of Edom weren disturblid; tremblyng held the stronge men of Moab.
Alle the dwelleris of Canaan `weren starke; inward drede falle on hem, and outward drede in the greetnesse of thin arm. Be thei maad vnmouable as a stoon, til thi puple passe, Lord; til this thi puple passe, whom thou weldidist.
Thou schalt brynge hem in, and thou schalt plaunte in the hil of thin eritage; in the moost stidefast dwellyng place which thou hast wrouyt, Lord; Lord, thi seyntuarie, which thin hondis made stidefast.
The Lord schal `regne in to the world and ferthere.
Forsothe Farao, `a ridere, entride with his charis and knyytis in to the see, and the Lord brouyte the watris of the se on hem; sotheli the sones of Israel yeden bi the drie place, in the myddis of the see.
Therfore Marie, profetesse, the `sistir of Aaron, took a tympan in hir hond, and alle the wymmen yeden out aftir hyr with tympans and cumpanyes;
to whiche sche song bifore, and seide, Synge we to the Lord, for he is magnyfied gloriousli; he castide doun in to the see the hors and the stiere of hym.
Forsothe Moises took Israel fro the reed see, and thei yeden out in to the deseert of Sur, and thei yeden thre daies bi the wildirnesse, and thei founden not watir.
And thei camen in to Marath, and thei miyten not drynk the watris of Marath, for tho weren bittere; wherfor and he puttide a couenable name to the place, and clepide it Mara, that is, bitternesse.
And the puple grutchide ayens Moises, and seide, What schulen we drynke?
And Moises criede to the Lord, which schewide to hym a tre; and whanne he hadde put that tre in to watris, tho weren turned in to swetnesse. There the Lord ordeynede comaundementis and domes to the puple, and there he asayede the puple,
and seide, If thou schalt here the vois of thi Lord God, and schalt do that that is riytful byfore hym, and schalt obeie to his comaundementis, and schalt kepe alle hise heestis, Y schal not brynge yn on thee al the syknesse, which Y puttide in Egipt, for Y am thi Lord Sauyour.

Forsothe the sones of Israel camen in to Helym, where weren twelue wellis of watris, and seuenti palm trees, and thei settiden tentis bisidis the watris. And thei yeden forth fro Helym, and al the multitude of the sones of Israel cam in to deseert of Syn, which is bitwixe Helym and Synai, in the fiftenethe dai of the secunde monethe aftir that thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt.
And al the congregacioun of the sones of Israel grutchide ayens Moises, and ayens Aaron, in the wildirnesse.
And the sones of Israel seiden to hem, We wolden that we hadden be deed bi the `hoond of the Lord in the lond of Egipt, whanne we saten on the `pottis of fleisch, and eeten looues in plentee; whi leden ye vs in to this deseert, that ye schulden sle al the multitude with hungur?
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! Y schal reyne to you looues fro heuene; the puple go out, that it gadere tho thingis that sufficen bi ech day; that Y asaie the puple, whethir it goith in my lawe, ether nai.
Sotheli in the sixte dai make thei redi that that thei schulen bere yn, and be it double ouer that thei weren wont to gadere bi ech dai.
And Moises and Aaron seiden to alle the sones of Israel, At euentid ye schulen wite that the Lord ledde you out of the lond of Egipt;
and in the morewetid ye schulen se the glorie of the Lord; for Y herde youre grutchyng ayens the Lord; sotheli what ben we, for ye grutchen ayens us?
And Moises seide, The Lord schal yyue to you at euentid fleischis to ete, and looues in the morewetid in plentee, for he herde youre grutchyngis, bi which ye grutchiden ayens hym; for whi, what ben we? youre grutchyng is not ayens vs but ayens the Lord.
And Moises seide to Aaron, Seie thou to al the congregacioun of the sones of Israel, Neiye ye bifore the Lord, for he herde youre grutchyng.
And whanne Aaron spak to al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, thei bihelden to the wildirnesse, and lo! the glorie of the Lord apperide in a cloude.
Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Y herde the grutchyngis of the sones of Israel; spek thou to hem, At euentid ye schulen ete fleischis, and in the morewtid ye schulen be fillid with looues, and ye schulen wite that Y am `youre Lord God.
Therfor euentid was maad, and `curlewes stieden and hiliden the castels; and in the morewtid deew cam bi the face of the castels.
And whanne it hadde hilid the erthe, a litil thing, and as powned with a pestel, in the licnesse of an hoorfrost on erthe, apperide in the wildirnesse.
And whanne the sones of Israel hadden seyn that, thei seiden to gidere, Man hu? which signyfieth, what is this? for thei wisten not what it was. To whiche Moises seide, This is the breed, which the Lord hath youe to you to ete.
This is the word which the Lord comaundide, Ech man gadere therof as myche as suffisith to be etun, gomor bi ech heed, bi the noumbre of youre soulis that dwellen in the tabernacle, so ye schulen take.
And the sones of Israel diden so, and thei gaderiden oon more, another lesse;
and thei metiden at the mesure gomor; nethir he that gaderide more had more, nethir he that made redi lesse fond lesse, but alle gaderiden bi that that thei myyten ete.
And Moises seide to hem, Noon leeue therof in to the morewtid; whiche herden not him,
but summe of hem leften til to the morewtid, and it bigan to buyle with wormes, and it was rotun; and Moises was wrooth ayens hem.
Forsothe alle gaderiden in the morewtid as myche as `miyte suffice to be eten; and whanne the sunne was hoot, it was moltun.
Sotheli in the sixte dai thei gaderiden double metis, that is, `twei gomor by ech man. Forsothe alle the princis of the multitude camen, and telden to Moises, which seide to hem,
This it is that the Lord spak, The reste of the sabot is halewid to the Lord, do ye what euer thing schal be wrouyt to morewe, and sethe ye tho thingis that schulen be sodun; sotheli what euer thing is residue, kepe ye til in to the morewe.
And thei diden so as Moises comaundide, and it was not rotun, nether a worm was foundun ther ynne.
And Moises seide, Ete ye that in this dai, for it is the sabat of the Lord, it schal not be foundun to dai in the feeld; gadere ye in sixe daies,
forsothe the sabat of the Lord is in the seuenthe dai, therfor it schal not be foundun.
The seuenthe dai cam, and summe of the puple yeden out `to gadire, and thei founden not.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Hou long `nylen ye kepe my comaundementis, and my lawe?
Se ye that the Lord yaf to you the sabat, and for this he yaf to you in the sixte dai double meetis; ech man dwelle at him silf, noon go out of his place in the seuenthe dai.
And the puple kepte sabat in the seuenthe dai.
And the hous of Israel clepide the name therof man, which was whijt as the seed of coriandre, and the taast therof was as of flour with hony.
Forsothe Moises seide, This is the word which the Lord comaundide, Fille thou a gomor therof, and be it kept in to generaciouns to comynge aftirward, that thei knowe the breed bi which Y fedde you in the wildirnesse, whanne ye weren led out of the lond of Egipt.
And Moises seide to Aaron, Take thou o vessel, and putte therinne man, as myche as gomor mai take, and putte bifore the Lord, to be kept in to youre generaciouns,
as the Lord comaundide to Moises; and Aaron puttide that to be kept in the tabernacle.
Forsothe the sones of Israel eeten manna in fourti yeer, til thei camen in to the lond abitable; thei weren fed with this mete til thei touchiden the endis of the lond of Canaan.
Forsothe gomor is the tenthe part of efy.
Therfor al the multitude of the sones of Israel yede forth fro the deseert of Syn, bi her dwellyngis, bi the word of the Lord, and settiden tentis in Rafidym, where was not watir to the puple to drynke.
Whiche puple chidde ayens Moises, and seide, Yyue thou water to vs, that we drynke. To whiche Moises answeride, What chiden ye ayens me, and whi tempten ye the Lord?
Therfor the puple thristide there for the scarsnesse of watir, and grutchiden ayens Moises, and seide, Whi madist thou vs to go out of Egipt, to sle vs, and oure fre children, and beestis, for thrist?
Forsothe Moises criede to the Lord, and seide, What schal Y do to this puple? yit a litil, also it schal stone me.
The Lord seide to Moises, Go thou bifore the puple, and take with thee of the eldre men of Israel, and take in thin hond the yerde, `bi which thou hast smyte the flood, and go; lo!
Y schal stonde there before thee, aboue the stoon of Oreb, and thou schalt smyte the stoon, and water schal go out therof, that the puple drynke. Moises dide so byfore the eldere men of Israel;
and he clepide the name of that place Temptacioun, for the chidyng of the sones of Israel, and for thei temptiden the Lord, and seiden, Whether the Lord is in vs, ether nay?
Forsothe Amalech cam, and fauyt ayens Israel in Rafidym.
And Moises seide to Josue, Chese thou men, and go out, and fiyte to morewe ayens men of Amalech; lo! Y schal stonde in the cop of the hil, and Y schal haue `the yerde of God in myn hond.
Josue dide as Moises spak, and fauyt ayens Amalech. Forsothe Moises, and Aaron, and Hur stieden on the cop of the hil;
and whanne Moises reiside the hondis, Israel ouercam; forsothe if he let down a litil, Amalech ouercam.
Sotheli `the hondis of Moises weren heuy, therfor thei token a stoon, and puttide vndir hym, in which stoon he sat. Forsothe Aaron and Hur susteyneden hise hondis, on euer eithir side; and it was don, that hise hondis weren not maad weri, til to the goyng down of the sunne.
And Josue droof a wey Amalech and his puple, in `the mouth of swerd, that is, bi the scharpnesse of the swerd.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Wryte thou this in a book, for mynde, and take in the eeris of Josue; for Y schal do a wei the mynde of Amalech fro vndur heuene.
And Moises bildide an auter, and clepide the name therof The Lord myn enhaunsere,
and seide, For the hond of the Lord aloone, and the bateil of God schal be ayens Amalech, fro generacioun in to generacioun.
And whanne Jetro, the prest of Madian, `the alye of Moises, hadde herd alle thingis which God hadde do to Moises, and to Israel his puple, for the Lord hadde led Israel out of the lond of Egipt,
he took Sefora, `the wijf of Moises, whom he hadde sent ayen,
and hise twei sones, of which oon was clepid Gersan, for the fadir seide, Y was a comelyng in alien lond,
forsothe the tother was clepid Eliezer, for Moises seide, God of my fadir is myn helpere, and he delyuerede me fro the swerd of Farao.
Therfor Jetro, `alie of Moises, cam, and the sones of Moises and his wijf camen to Moises, in to deseert, where Jetro settide tentis bisidis the hil of God;
and sente to Moises, and seide, Y Jetro, thin alie, come to thee, and thi wijf, and thi twei sones with hir.
And Moises yede out into the comyng of his alie, and worschipide, and kiste hym, and thei gretten hem silf to gidere with pesible wordis.
And whanne he hadde entrid in to the tabernacle, Moises tolde to `his alie alle thingis whiche God hadde do to Farao, and to Egipcians, for Israel, and he tolde al the trauel which bifelle to hem in the weie, of which the Lord delyuerede hem.
And Jetro was glad on alle the goodis whiche the Lord hadde do to Israel, for he delyuerede Israel fro the hond of Egipcians.
And Jetro seide, Blessid be `the Lord, that delyuerede you fro the hond of Egipcians, and fro `the hond of Farao, which Lord delyuered his puple fro the hond of Egipt;
now Y knowe that the Lord is greet aboue alle goddis, for `thei diden proudli ayens hem.
Therfor Jetro, `alie of Moises, offride brent sacrifices and offryngis to God; and Aaron, and alle the eldere men of Israel, camen to ete breed with hym bifore God.
Forsothe in the tother dai Moises sat that he schulde deme the puple, that stood niy Moises, fro the morewtid til to euentid.
And whanne `his alie hadde seyn this, that is, alle thingis `whiche he dide in the puple, he seide, What is this that thou doist in the puple? whi sittist thou aloone, and al the puple abidith fro the morewtid til to euentid?
To whom Moises answeride, The puple cometh to me, and axith the sentence of God;
and whanne ony strijf bifallith to hem, thei comen to me, that Y deme bitwixe hem, and schewe `the comaundementis of God, and hise lawis.
And Jetro seide, Thou doist a thing not good,
thou art wastid with a fonned trauel, bothe thou and this puple which is with thee; the werk is a boue thi strengthis, thou aloone maist not suffre it.
But here thou my wordis and counseils, and the Lord schal be with thee; be thou to the puple in these thingis that perteynen to God, that thou telle the thingis that ben seid to the puple;
and schewe to the puple the cerymonyes, and custom of worschipyng, and the weie bi which `thei owen to go, and the werk which `thei owen to do.
Forsothe puruey thou of al the puple myyti men, and dredynge God, in whiche is treuthe, and whiche haten auarice; and ordeyne thou of hem tribunes, and centuriouns, and quinquagenaries, and deenys,
whiche schulen deme the puple in al tyme; sotheli what ever thing is grettere, telle thei to thee, and deme thei ooneli lesse thingis, and be it esiere to thee, whanne the burthun is departid in to othere men.
If thou schalt do this, thou schalt fille the comaundement of God, and thou schalt mowe bere hise comaundementis; and al this puple schal turne ayen with pees to her places.
And whanne these thingis weren herd, Moises dide alle thingis whiche Jetro counselide.
And whanne noble men of al Israel weren chosun Moises ordeynede hem princis of the puple, tribunes, and centuriouns, and quinquagenaries, and denes,
whiche demeden the puple in al tyme; forsothe, whateuer thing was hardere, thei telden to Moises, and thei demeden esiere thingis oneli.
And Moises lefte `his alie, which turnede ayen, and yede in to his lond.
In the thridde monethe of the goyng `of Israel out of the lond of Egipt, in this dai thei camen in to the wildirnesse of Synai;
for thei yeden forth fro Rafidym, and camen til in to deseert of Synai, and settiden tentis in the same place; and there Israel settide tentis, euen ayens the hil.
Forsothe Moises stiede in to the hil to God; and the Lord clepide hym fro the mount, and seide, Thou schalt seie these thingis to the hows of Jacob, and thou schalt telle to the sones of Israel,
Ye silf han seyn what thingis Y haue do to Egipcians, how Y bar you on the wengis of eglis, and took to me.
Therfor if ye schulen here my vois, and schulen kepe my couenaunt, ye schulen be to me in to a specialte of alle puplis; for al the lond is myn;
and ye schulen be to me in to a rewme of preesthod, and `ye schulen be an hooli folk; these ben the wordis whiche thou schalt speke to the sones of Israel.
Moyses cam, and whanne the gretter men in birthe of the puple weren clepid to gidere, he expownede alle the wordis whiche the Lord comaundide.
And alle the puple answeride to gidere, We schulen do alle thingis whiche the Lord spak. And whanne Moises hadde teld the wordis of the puple to the Lord,
the Lord seide to hym, Riyt now Y schal come to thee in a derknesse of a cloude, that the puple here me spekynge to thee, and bileue to thee withouten ende. Therfor Moises telde the wordis of the puple to the Lord,
which seide to Moises, Go thou to the puple, and make hem holi to dai and to morewe, and waische thei her clothis,
and be thei redi in to the thridde dai; for in the thridde dai the Lord schal come doun bifore al the puple on the hil of Synai.
And thou schalt sette termes to the puple, bi cumpas; and thou schalt seie to hem, Be ye war, that ye `stie not in to the hil, nether touche ye the endis therof; ech man that schal touche the hil, schal die bi deeth.
Hondis schulen not touche hym, but he schal be oppressid with stoonus, ethir he shall be persid with dartis; whether it schal be a beest, ethir a man, it schal not lyue; whanne a clarioun schal bigynne to sowne, thanne `stie thei in to the hil.
And Moises cam doun fro the hil to the puple, and halewide it; and whanne thei hadden waischun her clothis,
he seide to hem, Be ye redi in to the thridde dai, neiye ye not to youre wyues.
And now the thridde day was comun, and the morewetid was cleer; and, lo! thundris bigunnen to be herd, and leitis to schyne, and a moost thicke cloude to hile the mounteyn; and `the sownyng of a clarioun made noise ful greetli, and the puple dredde, that was in the castels.
And whanne Moises hadde led hem out in to the comyng of God, fro the place of castels, thei stoden at the rootis of the hil.
Forsothe al the hil of Synai smokide, for the Lord hadde come doun theronne in fier; and smoke stiede therof as of a furneis, and al the hil was ferdful;
and the `sown of a clarioun encreesside litil and litil, and was holdun forth lengere. Moises spak, and the Lord answeride to hym,
and the Lord cam doun on the hil of Synay, in thilke cop of the hil, and clepide Moises to the cop therof. And whanne he hadde stied thidur,
the Lord seide to hym, Go thou doun, and witnesse thou to the puple, lest perauenture it wole passe the termes to se the Lord, and ful greet multitude therof perische;
also preestis, that neiyen to the Lord, be halewid, lest Y smyte hem.
And Moises seide to the Lord, The comyn puple may not stie in to the hil of Synai; for thou hast witnessid, and hast comaundid, seiyinge, Sette thou termes aboute the hil, and halewe it.
To whom the Lord seide, Go thou doun, and thou schalt stie, and Aaron with thee; forsothe the preestis and the puple passe not the termes, nethir stie thei to the Lord, lest perauenture he sle hem.
Moises yede doun to the puple, and telde alle thingis to hem.
And the Lord spak alle these wordis, Y am thi Lord God,
that ladde thee out of the lond of Egipt, fro the hous of seruage.
Thou schalt not haue alien goddis bifore me.
Thou schalt not make to thee a grauun ymage, nethir ony licnesse of thing which is in heuene aboue, and which is in erthe bynethe, nether of tho thingis, that ben in watris vndur erthe; thou schalt not `herie tho,
nether `thou schalt worschipe; for Y am thi Lord God, a stronge gelouse louyere; and Y visite the wickidnesse of fadris in to the thridde and the fourthe generacioun of hem that haten me,
and Y do mercy in to `a thousynde, to hem that louen me, and kepen myn heestis.
Thou schalt not take in veyn the name of thi Lord God, for the Lord schal not haue hym giltles, that takith in veyn the name of his Lord God.
Haue thou mynde, that thou halowe the `dai of the sabat;
in sixe daies thou schalt worche and schalt do alle thi werkis;
forsothe in the seuenthe day is the sabat of thi Lord God; thou schalt not do ony werk, thou, and thi sone, and thi douytir, and thi seruaunt, and thin handmaide, thi werk beeste, and the comelyng which is withynne thi yatis;
for in sixe dayes God made heuene and erthe, the see, and alle thingis that ben in tho, and restide in the seuenthe dai; herfor the Lord blesside the `dai of the sabat, and halewide it.
Onoure thi fadir and thi moder, that thou be long lyuyng on the lond, which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
Thou schalt not sle.
Thou schalt `do no letcherie.
Thou schalt `do no theft.
Thou schalt not speke fals witnessyng ayens thi neiybore.
Thou schalt not coueyte `the hous of thi neiybore, nether thou schalt desyre his wijf, not seruaunt, not handmaide, not oxe, not asse, nether alle thingis that ben hise.
Forsothe al the puple herde voices, and siy laumpis, and the sowne of a clarioun, and the hil smokynge; and thei weren afeerd, and schakun with inward drede, and stoden afer,
and seiden to Moises, Speke thou to vs, and we schulen here; the Lord speke not to vs, lest perauenture we dien.
And Moises seide to the puple, Nyle ye drede, for God cam to proue you, and that his drede schulde be in you, and that ye schulden not do synne.
And the puple stood afer; forsothe Moises neiyede to the derknesse, wherynne God was.
And the Lord seide ferthermore to Moises, Thou schalt seie these thingis to the sones of Israel, Ye seiyen that fro heuene Y spak to you;
ye schulen not make goddis of silver, nethir ye schulen make to you goddis of gold.
Ye schulen make an auter of erthe to me, and ye schulen offre theronne youre brent sacrifices, and pesible sacrifices, youre scheep, and oxun, in ech place in which the mynde of my name schal be; Y schal come to thee, and Y schal blesse thee.
That if thou schalt make an auter of stoon to me, thou schalt not bilde it of stoonys hewun; for if thou schalt reise thi knyif theronne, it schal be `polluted, ether defoulid.
Thou schalt not stye bi grees to myn auter, lest thi filthe be schewid.
These ben the domes, whiche thou schalt sette forth to hem.
If thou biest an Ebrew seruaunt, he schal serue thee sixe yeer; in the seuenthe yeer he schal go out fre,
with out prijs; with what maner clooth he entride, with siche clooth go he out; if he entride hauynge a wijf, and the wijf schal go out to gidere.
But if the lord of the servaunt yaf a wijf to hym, and sche childide sones and douytris, the womman and hir children schulen be hir lordis; sotheli the seruaunt schal go out with his owne clooth.
That if the seruaunt seith, Y loue my lord, and wijf, and children, Y schal not go out fre;
the lord brynge hym to goddis, that is, iugis; and he schal be set to the dore, and postis; and the lord schal perse his eere with a nal, and he schal be seruaunt to hym til in to the world.
If ony man sillith his douyter in to seruauntesse, sche schal not go out as handmaidis weren wont to go out;
if sche displesith in the iyen of hir lord, to whom sche was bitakun, he schal delyuere hir; sotheli he schal not haue power to sille hir to an alien puple, if he forsakith hir.
Forsothe if he weddith hir to his sonne, he schal do to hir `bi the custom of douytris;
that if he takith another womman to hym, he schal puruey to the damysele weddingis, and clothis, and he schal not denye the prijs of chastite.
If he doith not these thre, sche schal go out freli without money.
He that smytith a man, and wole sle, die bi deeth;
forsothe if a man settide not aspies, but God `bitook hym in to hise hondis, Y schal ordeyne a place to thee, whidur he owith to fle.
If ony man sleeth his neiybore bi biforecastyng, and bi aspies, drawe thou hym awey fro myn auter, that he die.
He that smytith his fadir, ether modir, die by deeth.
He that cursith his fadir, ether modir, die bi deeth.
He that stelith a man, and sillith hym, if he is conuyt of the gilt, die bi deeth.
If men chiden, and the tother smyte his neiybore with a stoon, ether with the fist, and he is not deed, but liggith in the bed,
if he risith, and goith forth on his staf, he that smoot schal be innocent; so netheles that he restore hise trauelis, and costis in lechis.
He that smytith his seruaunt, ether handmayde, with a yerde, and thei ben deed in hise hondis, schal be gilti of cryme.
Sotheli if the seruaunt ouerlyueth o dai, ether tweyne, he schal not be suget to peyne, `that is of deeth, for the seruaunt is his catel.
If men chiden, and a man smytith a womman with childe, and sotheli makith the child deed borun, but the womman ouerlyueth, he schal be suget to the harm, as myche as the `hosebonde of the womman axith, and the iugis demen.
But if the deeth of hir sueth,
he schal yelde lijf for lijf, iye for iye, tooth for tooth, hond for hond, foot for foot,
brennyng for brennyng, wounde `with schedyng of blood for wounde `with schedyng of blood, `a wan wounde for a wan wounde.
If a man smytith the iye of his seruaunt, ethir of handmaide, and makith hem oon iyed, he schal delyuere hem fre for `the iye which he puttide out.
Also if he smytith out a tooth fro his seruaunt, ethir handmaide, in lijk maner he schal delyuere hem fre.
If an oxe smytith with horn a man, ether a womman, and thei ben deed, the oxe schal be oppressid with stoonus, and hise fleischis schulen not be etun, and the lord of the oxe schal be innocent.
That if the oxe was `a pultere with horn fro yisterdai and the thridde dai ago, and men warneden `the lord of hym, nether the lord closide hym, and he sleeth a man, ethir womman, bothe the oxe schal be oppressid with stoonus, and thei schulen sle `the lord of hym;
that if prijs is put to the lord, he schal yyue for his lijf what euer he is axide.
And if he smytith with horn a son, and a douytir, he schal be suget to lijk sentence.
If the oxe asailith a seruaunt, and handmaide, the lord of the oxe schal yyue thretti siclis of siluer to `his lord; forsothe the oxe schal be oppressid with stoonus.
If ony man openeth a cisterne, and diggith, and hilith it not, and an oxe ether asse fallith in to it,
the lord of the cisterne schal yelde the prijs of the werk beestis; forsothe that that is deed schal be his.
If another mannus oxe woundith the oxe of another man, and he is deed, thei schulen sille the quyke oxe, and thei schulen departe the prijs; forsothe thei schulen departe bitwixe hem the karkeis of the deed oxe.
Forsothe if his lord wiste, that the oxe was a puttere fro yistirdai and the thridde dai ago, and kepte not him, he schal yelde oxe for oxe, and he schal take the hool carkeys.
If ony man stelith a scheep, ether oxe, and sleeth, ether sillith, he schal restore fiue oxen for oon oxe, and foure scheep for o scheep.
And if a nyyt theef brekynge an hows, ether vndurmynynge, is foundun, and is deed bi a wounde takun, the smytere schal not be gilti of blood;
that if he dide this whanne the sunne was rysun, he dide man sleyng, and he schal die. If a theef hath not that, that he schal yelde for thefte, he schal be seeld;
if that thing that he staal, is foundun quyk at hym, ether oxe, ether asse, ether scheep, he schal restore the double.
If a man harmeth a feeld, ethir vyner, and suffrith his beeste, that it waaste othere mennus thingis, he schal restore for the valu of harm, `what euer beste thing he hath in his feeld, ethir vyner.
If fier goith out, and fyndith eeris of corn, and catchith heepis of corn, ethir cornes stondynge in feeldis, he that kyndlide the fier schal yeelde the harm.
If a man bitakith in to kepyng monei to a freend, ether a vessel `in to keping, and it is takun awey bi thefte fro hym that resseyuede, if the theef is foundun, he schal restore the double.
If the theef is hid, the lord of the hows schal be brouyt to goddis, `that is, iugis, and he schal swere, that he helde not forth the hond in to `the thing of his neiybore,
to `do fraude; as wel in oxe, as in asse, and in scheep, and in clooth; and what euer thing may brynge in harm, the cause of euer eithir schal come to goddis, and if thei demen, he schal restore the double to his neiybore.
If ony man bitakith to his neiybore oxe, asse, scheep, and al werk beeste to kepyng, and it is deed, ether is maad feble, ethir is takun of enemyes, and no man seeth this,
an ooth schal be in the myddis, that he helde not forth the hond to the `thing of his neiybore; and the lord schal resseyue the ooth, and he schal not be compellid to yelde.
That if it is takun awei bi thefte, he schal restore the harm to the lord;
if it is etun of a beeste, he schal brynge to the lord that that is slayn, and he schal not restore.
He that axith of his neiybore ony thing of these bi borewyng, and it is feblid, ether deed, while the lord is not present, he schal be constreyned to yelde; that if the lord is in presence,
he schal not restore, moost if it cam hirid, for the meede of his werk.
If a man disseyueth a virgyn not yit weddid, and slepith with hir, he schal yyue dower to hir, and schal haue hir wijf.
If the fadir of the virgyn nyle yyue, he schal yelde money, bi the maner of dower, which virgyns weren wont to take.
Thou schalt not suffre witchis to lyue.
He that doith letcherie with a beeste, die by deeth.
He that offrith to goddis, out takun to the Lord aloone, be he slayn.
Thou schalt not make sory a comelyng, nether thou schalt turmente hym; for also ye weren comelyngis in the lond of Egipt.
Ye schulen not anoye a widewe, and a fadirles ethir modirles child.
If ye hirten hem, thei schulen crye to me, and Y schal here the cry of hem,
and my greet veniaunce schal haue indignacioun, and Y schal smyte you with swerd, and youre wyues schulen be widewis, and youre sones schulen be fadirles.
If thou yyuest money to loone to my pore puple, that dwellith with thee, thou schalt not constreyne hym, as an extorsioner doith, nether thou schalt oppresse hym by vsuris.
If thou takist of thi neiybore `a wed a clooth, thou schalt yelde to hym bifore the goyng doun of the sunne;
for that aloone is the cloothing of his fleisch, with which he is hilid, nether he hath another, in which he slepith; if he crieth to me, Y schal here hym; for Y am mercyful.
Thou schalt not bacbyte goddis, and thou schalt not curse the prince of thi puple.
Thou schalt not tarye to offre to the Lord thi tithis, and firste fruytis. Thou schalt yyue to me the firste gendrid of thi sones;
also of oxen, and of scheep thou schalt do in lijk maner; seuene daies be he with his modir, in the eiytithe dai thou schalt yelde hym to me.
Ye schulen be holi men to me; ye schulen not ete fleisch which is bifore taastid of beestis, but ye schulen caste forth to houndis.
Thou schalt not resseyue a vois of leesyng, nether thou schalt ioyne thin hond, that thou seie fals witnessyng for a wickid man.
Thou schalt not sue the cumpanye to do yuel, nether thou schalt ascente to the sentence of ful many men in doom, that thou go awey fro treuthe.
Also thou schalt not haue mercy of a pore man in a `cause, ethir doom.
If thou meetist `the oxe of thin enemye, ethir the asse errynge, lede thou ayen to hym.
If thou seest that the asse of hym that hatith thee liggyth vndir a burthun, thou schalt not passe, but thou schalt reise with hym.
Thou schalt not bowe in the doom of a pore man.
Thou schalt fle a lesyng. Thou schalt not sle an innocent man, and iust; for Y am aduersarie to a wickid man.
Take thou not yiftis, that blynden also prudent men, and destryen the wordys of iust men.
Thou schalt not be diseseful to a pilgrym, for ye knowen the soulis of comelyngis, for also ye weren pilgryms in the lond of Egipt.
Sixe yeer thou schalt sowe thi lond, and thou schalt gadre fruytis therof;
forsothe in the seuenthe yeer thou schalt leeue it, and schalt make to reste, that the pore men of thi puple ete, and what euer is residue, the beestis of the feeld ete; so thou schalt do in thi vyner, and in place of olyue trees.
Sixe dayes thou schalt worche, in the seuenthe dai thou schalt ceesse, that thin oxe and asse reste, and the sone of thin handmaide, and the comelyng be refreischid.
Kepe ye alle thingis, whiche Y seide to you; and ye schulen not swere bi the name of alien goddis, nether it schal be herd of youre mouth.

Thou schalt kepe the solempnyte of therf looues; seuene daies thou schalt ete therf breed, as Y comaundide to thee, in the tyme of monethe of newe thingis, whanne thou yedist out of Egipt; thou schalt not appere voide in my siyt.
And thou schalt kepe the solempnete of the monethe of the firste thingis of thi werk, what euer thingis thou hast sowe in the feeld. Also thou schalt kepe the solempnyte in the goyng out of the yeer, whanne thou hast gaderid all thi fruytis of the feeld.
Thries in the yeer al thi male kynde schal appere bifore thi Lord God.
Thou schalt not offre the blood of thi slayn sacrifice on sour douy; nether the fatnesse of my solempnete schal dwelle til to the morewtid.
Thou schalt bere the firste thingis of the fruytis of thi lond in to the hows of thi Lord God. Thou schalt not sethe a kide in the mylke of his modir.
Lo! Y schal sende myn aungel, that schal go bifore thee, and schal kepe in the weie, and schal lede to the place which Y haue maad redi to thee.
Take thou hede to hym, and here thou his vois, nether gesse thou hym to be dispisid; for he schal not foryyue, whanne thou synnest, and my name is in him.
For if thou herest his vois, and doist alle thingis whiche Y speke, Y schal be enemy to thin enemyes, and Y schal turment hem, that turmenten thee;
and myn aungel schal go bifore thee, and he schal lede yn thee to Amorrei, and Ethei, and Ferezei, and Cananey, and Euey, and Jebusei, whiche Y schal breke.
Thou schalt not onoure `the goddis of hem, nether thou schalt worschipe hem; thou schalt not do the werkis of hem, but thou schalt destrie the goddis, and thou schalt breke the ymagis of hem.
And ye schulen serue to youre Lord God, that Y blesse thi looues, and watris, and do awei sikenesse fro the myddis of thee;

Forsothe Y schal sette thi termys fro the reed see til to the see of Palestyns, and fro desert til to the flood. Y schal yyue to youre hondis the dwelleris of the lond, and Y schal caste hem out fro youre siyt;

Dwelle thei not in thi lond, lest perauenture thei make thee to do synne ayens me, yf thou seruest her goddis, which thing certis schal be to thee in to sclaundir.
Also he seide to Moises, `Stie thou to the Lord, thou, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abyu, and seuenti eldere men of Israel; and ye schulen worschipe afer,
and Moises aloone stie to the Lord, and thei schulen not neiye, nether the puple schal stie with hym.
Therfore Moises cam, and telde to the puple alle the wordis and domes of the Lord; and al the puple answeride with o vois, We schulen do alle the wordis of the Lord, whiche he spak.
Forsothe Moises wroot alle the wordis of the Lord; and he roos eerli, and bildide an auter to the Lord at the rootis of the hil, and he bildide twelue titlis bi twelue lynagis of Israel.
And he sente yonge men of the sones of Israel, and thei offriden brent sacrifices, and `thei offriden pesible sacrifices `to the Lord, twelue calues.
And so Moises took half the part of the blood, and sente in to grete cuppis; forsothe he schedde the residue part on the auter.
And he took the book of the boond of pees, and redde, while the puple herde; whiche seiden, We schulen do alle thingis which the Lord spak, and we schulen be obedient.
Forsothe he took, and sprengide `the blood on the puple, and seide, This is the blood of the boond of pees, which the Lord couenauntide with yow on alle these wordis.
And Moises, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abyu, and seuenti of the eldere men of Israel stieden,

And he sente not his hond on hem of the sones of Israel, that hadden go fer awei; and thei sien God, and eeten and drunkun.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, `Stie thou to me in to the hil, and be thou there, and Y schal yyue to thee tablis of stoon, and the lawe, and comaundementis, whiche Y haue write, that thou teche the children of Israel.
Moises and Josue his mynystre risen, and Moises stiede in to the hil of God,
and seide to the eldere men, Abide ye here, til we turnen ayen to you; ye han Aaron and Hur with you, if ony thing of questioun is maad, ye schulen telle to hem.
And whanne Moises hadde stied,
a cloude hilide the hil, and the glorie of the Lord dwellide on Synai, and kyueride it with a cloude sixe daies; forsothe in the seuenthe dai the Lord clepide hym fro the myddis of the cloude; forsothe the licnesse of glorie of the Lord

And Moises entride into the myddis of the cloude, and stiede in to the hil, and he was there fourti daies and fourti nyytis.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,

And thou schalt take the blood of the calf, and schalt putte with thi fyngur on the corneris of the auter. Forsothe thou schalt schede the `tothir blood bisidis the foundement therof.
And thou schalt take al the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis, and the calle of the mawe, and twey kidneris, and the fatnesse which is on hem; and thou schalt offere encense on the auter.
Forsothe thou schalt brenne with out the castels the `fleischis of the calf, and the skyn, and the dung, for it is for synne.
Also thou schalt take a ram, on whos heed Aaron and hise sones schulen sette hondis;
and whanne thou hast slayn that ram, thou schalt take of `his blood, and schalt schede aboute the auter.
Forsothe thou schalt kitte thilk ram in to smale gobetis, and thou schalt putte hise entrailis waischun, and feet on the fleischis koruun, and on his heed;
and thou schalt offre al the ram in to encence on the auter; it is an offryng to the Lord, the swettest odour of the slayn sacrifice of the Lord.
And thou schalt take the tothir ram, on whos heed Aaron and hise sones schulen sette hondis;
and whanne thou hast offrid that ram, thou schalt take of his blood, and schalt `putte on the last part of the riyt eere of Aaron, and of hise sones, and on the thombis of her hond; and of her riyt foot; and thou schalt schede the blood on the auter, `bi cumpas.
And whanne thou hast take of the blood, which is on the auter, and of oile of anoynting, thou schalt sprenge Aaron and hise clothis, the sones and her clothis. And whanne thei and the clothis ben sacrid,
thou schalt take the ynnere fatnesse of the ram, and the tayl, and the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis, and the calle of the mawe, and twey kideneris, and the fatnesse that is on tho; and thou schalt take the riyt schuldur, for it is the ram of consecracioun;
and thou schalt take a tendur cake of o loof, spreynd with oile, paast sodun in watir, and after fried in oile, of the panyer of therf looues, which is set in `the siyt of the Lord.
And thou schalt putte alle `thingis on the hondis of Aaron and of hise sones, and schalt halewe hem, and reise bifor the Lord.
And thou schalt take alle thingis fro `the hondis of hem, and schalt brenne on the autir, in to brent sacrifice, `swettist odour in the siyt of the Lord, for it is the offryng of the Lord.
Also thou schalt take the brest of the ram, bi which Aaron was halewid, and thou schalt halewe it reisid bifor the Lord; and it schal turne in to thi part.
And thou schalt halewe also the brest sacrid, and the schuldur which thou departidist fro the ram,
bi which Aaron was halewid, and hise sones; and tho schulen turne in to the part of Aaron, and of hise sones, bi euerlastinge riyt, of the sones of Israel; for tho ben the firste thingis, and the bigynnyngis of the pesible sacrifices of hem, whiche thei offren to the Lord.
Forsothe the sones of Aaron schulen haue aftir hym the hooli cloth, which Aaron schal vse, that thei be anoyntid ther ynne, and her hondis be sacrid.
`Thilke, that of hise sones schal be maad bischop for hym, schal vse that cloth seuene daies, and which sone schal entre in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, that he mynystre in the seyntuarie.
Sotheli thou schalt take the ram of consecracioun, and thou schalt sethe hise fleischis in the hooli place,
whiche fleischis Aaron and his sones schulen ete, and thei schulen ete the looues, that ben in the panyere, in the porche of the tabernacle of witnessyng,
that it be a pleasaunt sacrifice, and that the hondis of the offreris be halewid. An alien schal not ete of tho, for tho ben hooli.
That if ony thing leeueth of the fleischis halewid, ether of the looues, til the morewtid, thou schalt brenne the relifs by fier, thou schulen not be etun, for tho ben halewid.
Thou schalt do on Aaron, and hise sones, alle thingis whiche I comaunde to thee. Seuene daies thou schalt sacre `the hondis of hem,
and thou schalt offre a calf for synne bi ech day to clense; and thou schalt clense the auter, whanne thou hast offrid the sacrifice of clensyng, and thou schalt anoynte the auter in to halewyng.
Seuene daies thou shalt clense and halewe the auter, and it schal be the hooli of hooli thingis; ech man that schal touche it schal be halewid.
This it is, that thou schalt do in the auter, twei lambren of o yeer contynueli bi ech dai,
o lomb in the morewtid, and the tothir in the euentid;
`thou schalt do in o lomb the tenthe part of flour spreynt with oyle, powned, that schal haue a mesure, the fourthe part of hyn, and wyn of the same mesure, to make sacrifice.
Sotheli thou schalt offre the tother lomb at euentid, bi the custom of the offryng at the morewtid, and bi tho thingis, whiche we seiden, in to the odour of swetnesse;
it is a sacrifice to the Lord bi euerlastynge offryng in to youre generaciouns, at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng bifor the Lord, where Y schal ordeyne that Y speke to thee;
and there Y schal comaunde to the sones of Israel; and the auter schal be halewid in my glorie.
Y schal halewe also the tabernacle of witnessyng with the auter, and Aaron with hise sones, that thei be set in presthod to me.
And Y schal dwelle in the myddis of the sones of Israel, and Y schal be God to hem;
and thei schulen wite, that Y am her Lord God, which ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde dwelle among hem; for Y am her Lord God.
Also thou schalt make an auter of the trees of Sechym, to brenne encense;
and the auter schal haue a cubit of lengthe, and another cubit of brede, that is foure cornerid, and twei cubitis in heiythe; corneris schulen come forth of the auter.
And thou schalt clothe it with clennest gold, as wel the gridil therof, as the wallis and corneris bi cumpas therof; and thou schalt make to the auter a litil goldun coroun,
`bi cumpas, and twei goldun serclis vndur the coroun by alle sidis, that barris be put in to the serclis, and the auter be borun.
Also thou schalt make tho barris of the trees of Sechym, and thou schalt ouergilde;
and thou schalt sette the auter ayens the veil, which veil hangith bifor the ark of witnessyng bifor the propiciatorie, bi which the witnessyng is hilid, where Y schal speke to thee.
And Aaron schal brenne theronne encense smellynge swetly eerli; whanne he schal araye the lanternes, he schal brenne it;
and whanne he settith the lanternes at euentid, he schal brenne euerlastynge encense bifor the Lord, in to youre generaciouns.
Ye schulen not offre theronne encense of other makyng, nethir offryng, and slayn sacrifice, nether ye schulen offre fletynge offryngis thereonne.
And Aaron schal preie on the corneres therof onis bi the yeer, in the blood which is offrid for synne, and he schal plese theronne in youre generaciouns; it schal be the hooli of hooli thingis to the Lord.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Whanne thou schalt take the summe of the sones of Israel, alle bi hem silf schulen yyue `bi the noumbre prijs for her soulis to the Lord, and veniaunce schal not be in hem, whanne thei ben noumbrid.
Sotheli ech that passith to the name, schal yyue this, half a sicle bi the mesure of the temple; a sicle hath twenti halpens; the myddil part of a cicle schal be offrid to the Lord.
He that is hadde in noumbre, fro twenti yeer and aboue,
schal yyue prijs; a riche man schal not adde to the myddil of cicle, and a pore man schal no thing abate.
And thou schalt bitake in to vsis of the tabernacle of witnessyng the money takun, which is gaderid of the sones of Israel, that it be the mynde of hem bifor the Lord, and he schal be merciful to `the soulis of hem.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Also thou schalt make a greet vessil of bras with his foundement to waische, and thou schalt sette it bitwixe the tabernacle of witnessyng and the auter `of brent sacrifices; and whanne watir is put therynne,
Aaron and hise sones schulen waische therynne her hondis and feet,
whanne thei schulen entre in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, and whanne thei schulen neiye to the auter that thei offre therynne encense to the Lord,
lest perauenture thei dien; it schal be a lawful thing euerlastinge to hym and to his seed bi successiouns.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Take to thee swete smellynge spiceries, of the firste and chosun myrre, fyue hundrid siclis; and of canel the half, that is, twei hundrid and fifti siclis;
in lijk maner of calamy twei hundrid and fifti siclis; also of casia fyue hundrid siclis, in the weiyte of seyntuarie; oile of olyue trees, the mesure hyn ;
and thou schalt make the hooly oile of anoyntyng, an oynement maad bi the werk of a `makere of oynement.
And thou schal anoynte therof the tabernacle of witnessyng, and the ark of testament, and the boord with hise vessels,
the candilstike, and the purtenaunces therof, the auteris of encense,
and of brent sacrifice, and al the purtenaunce, that perteyneth to the ournyng of tho.
And thou schalt halewe alle thingis, and tho schulen be the hooli of holi thingis; he that schal touche tho, schal be halewid.
Thou schalt anoynte Aaron, and hise sones, and thou schalt halewe hem, that thei be set in presthod to me.
And thou schalt seie to the sones of Israel, This oile of anoyntyng schal be hooli to me in to youre generaciouns.
The fleisch of man schal not be anoyntid therof, and bi the makyng therof ye schulen not make another, for it is halewid, and it schal be hooli to you.
What euer man makith sich oile, and yyueth therof to an alien, he schal be `destried fro his puple.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Take to thee swete smellynge spyceries, stacten, and onyca, galban of good odour, and pureste encense, alle schulen be of euene weiyte.
And thou schal make encence, maad by werk of oynement makere, meddlid diligentli, and pure, and moost worthi of halewyng.
And whanne thou hast powned alle thingis in to smalleste poudre, thou schalt putte therof bifor the tabernacle of witnessyng, in which place Y schal appere to thee; encense schal be to you the hooli of hooli thingis.
Ye schulen not make siche a makyng in to youre vsis, for it is hooli to the Lord.
What euer man makith a lijk thing, that he vse the odour therof, he schal perische fro his puple.
And the Lord spak to Moyses, `and seide, Lo!
Y haue clepid Beseleel bi name, the sone of Hury, sone of Hur, of the lynage of Juda;
and Y haue fillid hym with the spirit of God, with wisdom, and vndirstondyng, and kunnyng in al werk,
to fynde out what euer thing may be maad suteli, of gold, and siluer, and bras, and marbil,
and gemmes, and dyuersite of trees.
And Y haue youe to hym a felowe, Ooliab, the sone of Achisameth, of the kynrede of Dan; and Y haue put in `the herte of hem the wisdom of ech lerned man, that thei make alle thingis, whiche Y comaundide to thee;
the tabernacle of boond of pees, and the arke of witnessyng, and the propiciatorie, ether table, which is theronne, and alle the vessels of the tabernacle;
also the bord, and vessels therof, the clenneste candilstike with hise vessels, and the auteris of encence,
and of brent sacrifice, and alle the vessels of hem; the greet `waischyng vessel with his foundement;
hooli clothis in seruyce to Aaron prest, and to hise sones, that thei be set in her office in hooli thingis;
the oile of anoyntyng, and encence of swete smellynge spiceryes in the seyntuarie; thei schulen make alle thingis whiche Y comaundide to thee.
And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seie to hem, Se ye that ye kepe my sabat, for it is a signe bytwixe me and you in youre generaciouns; that ye wite, that Y am the Lord, which halewe you.
Kepe ye my sabat, for it is hooli to you; he that defoulith it, schal die bi deeth, the soule of hym, that doith werk in the sabat, schal perische fro the myddis of his puple.
Sixe daies ye schulen do werk; in the seuenthe dai is sabat, hooli reste to the Lord; ech man that doith werk in this dai schal die.
The sones of Israel kepe sabat, and halewe it in her generaciouns;
it is a couenaunt euerlastinge bitwixe me and the sones of Israel, and it is `a signe euerlastynge; for in sixe daies God made heuene and erthe, and in the seuenthe day he ceessid of werk.
And whanne siche wordis weren fillid, the Lord yaf to Moises, in the hil of Synay, twei stonun tablis of witnessyng, writun with the fyngur of God
Forsothe the puple siy, that Moises made tariyng to come doun fro the hil, and it was gaderid ayens Aaron, and seide, Rise thou, and make goddis to vs, that schulen go bifore vs, for we witen not what bifelde to this Moises, that ladde vs out of the lond of Egipt.
And Aaron seide to hem, Take ye the goldun eere ryngis fro the eeris of youre wyues, and of sones and douytris, and brynge ye to me.
The puple dide tho thingis, that he comaundide, and brouyte eere ryngis to Aaron;
and whanne he hadde take tho, he formede bi `werk of yetyng, and made of tho a yotun calf. And thei seiden, Israel, these ben thi goddis, that ladde thee out of the lond of Egipt.
And whanne Aaron had seyn this thing, he bildide an auter bifore hym, and he criede bi the vois of a criere, and seide, To morewe is the solempnete of the Lord.
And thei rysen eerli, and offeriden brent sacrifyces, and pesible sacrifices; and the puple sat to ete and drynke, and thei risen to pley.
Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Go thou, go doun, thi puple hath synned, `whom thou leddist out of the lond of Egipt.
Thei yeden awei soone fro the weie which thou schewidst to hem, and thei maden to hem a yotun calf, and worschipyden it, and thei offeriden sacrifices to it, and seiden, Israel, these ben thi goddis, that ledden thee out of the lond of Egipt.
And eft the Lord seide to Moises, Y se, that this puple is of hard nol;
suffre thou me, that my woodnesse be wrooth ayens hem, and that Y do awey hem; and Y schal make thee in to a greet folk.
Forsothe Moises preiede `his Lord God, and seide, Lord, whi is thi veniaunce wrooth ayens thi puple, whom thou leddist out of the lond of Egipt in greet strengthe and in stronge hond?
Y biseche, that Egipcians seie not, he ledde hem out felli, `that he schulde sle in the hillis, and to do awei fro erthe, thin ire ceesse, and be thou quemeful on the wickidnesse of thi puple.
Haue thou mynde of Abraham, of Ysaac, and of Israel, thi seruauntis, to whiche thou hast swore bi thi silf, and seidist, Y schal multiplie youre seed as the sterris of heuene, and Y schal yyue to youre seed al this lond of which Y spak, and ye schulen welde it euere.
And the Lord was plesid, that he dide not the yuel which he spak ayens his puple.
And Moises turnede ayen fro the hil, and bar in his hond twei tablis of witnessyng, writun in euer either side,
and maad bi the werk of God; and the writyng of God was grauun in tablis.
Forsothe Josue herde the noise of the puple criynge, and seide to Moyses, Yellyng of fiytyng is herd in the castels.
To whom Moises answeride, It is not cry of men exitynge to batel, nether the cry of men compellynge to fleyng, but Y here the vois of syngeris.
And whanne he hadde neiyid to the castels, he siy the calf, and dauncis; and he was wrooth greetli, and `castide forth the tablis fro the hond, and brak tho at the rootis of the hil.
And he took the calf, which thei hadden maad, and brente, and brak `til to poudur, which he spreynte in to watir, and yaf therof drynke to the sones of Israel.
And Moises seide to Aaron, What dide this puple to thee, that thou brouytist in on hym the gretteste synne?
To whom he answeride, My lord, be not wrooth, for thou knowist this puple, that it is enclynaunt to yuel;
thei seiden to me, Make thou goddis to vs, that schulen go bifore vs, for we witen not, what bifelde to this Moises, that ladde vs out of the lond of Egipt.
To whiche Y seide, Who of you hath gold? Thei token, and yauen to me, and Y castide it forth in to the fier, and this calf yede out.
Therfor Moyses siy the puple, that it was maad bare; for Aaron hadde spuylid it for the schenschip of filthe, and hadde maad the puple nakid among enemyes.
And Moises stood in the yate of the castels, and seide, If ony man is of the Lord, be he ioyned to me; and alle the sones of Leuy weren gaderid to hym.
To whiche he seide, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, A man putte swerd on his hipe, go ye, and `go ye ayen fro yate `til to yate bi the myddil of the castels, and ech man sle his brother, freend, and neiybore.
The sones of Leuy diden bi the word of Moises, and as thre and twenti thousynd of men felden doun in that day.
And Moises seide, Ye han halewid youre hondis to dai to the Lord, ech man in his sone, and brother, that blessyng be youun to you.
Sotheli whanne `the tother day was maad, Moises spak to the puple, Ye han synned the moost synne; Y schal stie to the Lord, if in ony maner Y schal mowe biseche hym for youre felony.
And he turnede ayen to the Lord, and seide, Lord, Y biseche, this puple hath synned a greet synne, and thei han maad goldun goddis to hem; ethir foryyue thou this gilt to hem,
ether if thou doist not, do awey me fro thi book, which thou hast write.
To whom the Lord answeride, Y schal do awey fro my book hym that synneth ayens me;
forsothe go thou, and lede this puple, whydur Y spak to thee; myn aungel schal go bifore thee; forsothe in the day of veniaunce Y schal visite also this synne of hem.
Therfor the Lord smoot the puple for the gilt of the calf, which calf Aaron made.
And the Lord spak to Moyses, and seide, Go and stie fro this place, thou, and the puple, whom thou leddist out of the lond of Egipt, in to the lond, which Y haue swore to Abraham, and to Ysaac, and to Jacob, `and Y seide, Y schal yyue it to thi seed.
And Y schal sende thi bifore goere an aungel, that Y caste out Cananey, and Amorei, and Ethei, and Ferezei, and Euey, and Jebusey;
and that thou entre in to the lond flowynge with mylk and hony; for Y schal not stye with thee, for `thou art a puple of hard nol, lest perauenture Y leese thee in the weie.
The puple herde this worste word, and morenyde, and noon was clothid with his ournyng bi custom.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Spek thou to the sones of Israel, Thou art a puple of hard nol; onys Y schal stie in the myddis of thee, and Y schal do awey thee; riyt now putte awei thin ournyng, that Y wite, what Y schal do to thee.
Therfor the sones of Israel puttiden awey her ournyng fro the hil of Oreb.
And Moises took the tabernacle, and settide fer with out the castels, and he clepide the name therof the tabernacle of boond of pees. And al the puple that hadde ony questioun, yede out to the tabernacle of boond of pees, with out the castels.
And whanne Moises yede out to the tabernacle, al the puple roos, and ech man stood in the dore of his tente, and thei bihelden `the bak of Moises, til he entride in to the tente.
Sotheli whanne he entride in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, a piler of cloude cam doun, and stood at the dore; and the Lord spak with Moises,
while alle men sien that the piler of cloude stood at the `dore of tabernacle; and thei stoden, and worschipiden bi the dores of her tabernaclis.
Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises face to face, as a man is wont to speke to his freend; and whanne he turnede ayen in to `the castels, Josue, his mynystre, the sone of Nun, a child, yede not awey fro the tabernacle.
Forsothe Moises seide to the Lord, Thou comaundist, that Y lede out this puple, and thou `schewist not to me, whom thou schalt sende with me, `most sithen thou seidist, Y knewe thee bi name, and thou hast founde grace bifore me.
Therfore if Y haue founde grace in thi siyt, schewe thi face to me, that Y knowe thee, and fynde grace bifor thin iyen; biholde thi puple, and this folk.
And God seide, My face schal go bifor thee, and Y schal yyue reste to thee.
And Moises seide, If thi silf schalt not go bifore, `lede not vs out of this place;
for in what thing moun we wite, Y and thi puple, that we han founde grace in thi siyt, if thou schalt not go with vs, that we be glorified of alle puplis that dwellen on erthe?
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Y schal do also this word, which thou hast spoke; for thou hast founde grace bifor me, and Y knewe thi silf bi name.
And Moises seide, Schewe thou thi glorie to me.
God answeride, Y schal schewe al good to thee, and Y schal clepe in the `name of the Lord bifor thee, and Y schal do merci to whom Y wole, and Y schal be merciful on whom it plesith to me.
And eft God seide, Thou maist not se my face, for a man schal not se me, and schal lyue.
And eft God seide, A place is anentis me, and thou schalt stonde on a stoon;
and whanne my glorie schal passe, Y schal sette thee in the hoole of the stoon, and Y schal kyuere with my riyt hond, til Y passe; and Y schal take awey myn hond,
and thou schalt se myn hyndrere partis, forsothe thou mayst not se my face.
And aftirward God seide, Hewe to thee twey tablis of stoon at the licnesse of the formere, and Y schal write on tho tablis thilke wordis, whiche the tablis, that thou `hast broke, hadden.
Be thou redi in the morewtid, that thou stie anoon in to the hil of Synai; and thou schalt stonde with me on the cop of the hil;
no man stie with thee, nether ony man be seyn bi al the hil, and oxun and scheep be not fed ayens `the hil.
Therfor Moises hewide twey tablis of stoon, whiche manere tablis weren bifore, and he roos bi nyyt, and stiede in to the hil of Synay, as the Lord comaundide to hym; and he bar with hym the tablis.
And whanne the Lord hadde come doun bi a cloude, Moises stood with hym, and clepide inwardli `the name of the Lord;
and whanne the Lord passide bifore hym, he seide, Lordschipere, Lord God, mercyful, and pitouse, pacient, and of myche mersiful doyng, and sothefast,
which kepist couenaunt and mercy in to `a thousande, which doist awey wickidnesse, and trespassis, and synnes, and noon bi hym silf is innocent anentis thee, which yeldist the wickidnesse of fadris to sones and to sones of sones, into the thridde and fourthe generacioun.
And hastili Moises was bowid low `in to erthe, and worschipide,
and seide, Lord, if Y haue founde grace in thi siyt, Y biseche that thou go with vs, for the puple is of hard nol, and that thou do awey oure wickidnesses and synnes, and welde vs.
The Lord answeride, Y schal make couenaunt, and in siyt of alle men Y schal make signes, that weren neuer seyn on erthe, nether in ony folkis, that this puple, in whos myddis thou art, se the ferdful werk of the Lord, which Y schal make.
Kepe thou alle thingis, whiche Y comaundide to thee to dai; I my silf schal caste out bifor thi face Amorrey, and Cananey, and Ethei, and Ferezei, and Euey, and Jebusei.
Be war, lest ony tyme thou ioyne frendschipis with the dwelleris of that lond, whiche frenschipis be in to fallyng to thee.
But also distrie thou `the auteris of hem, breke the ymagis, and kitte doun the woodis;
`nyl thou worschipe an alien God; `the Lord a gelous louyere is his name, God is a feruent louyere;
make thou not couenaunt with the men of tho cuntreis, lest whanne thei han do fornycacioun with her goddis, and han worschipid the symylacris of hem, ony man clepe thee, that thou ete of thingis offrid to an ydol.
Nether thou schalt take a wyif of her douytris to thi sones, lest aftir that tho douytris han do fornycacioun, thei make also thi sones to do fornicacioun in to her goddis.
Thou schalt not make to thee yotun goddis.
Thou schalt kepe the solempynyte of therf looues; seuene daies thou schalt ete therf looues, as Y comaundide to thee, in the time of the monethe of newe fruytis; for in the monethe of veer tyme thou yedist out of Egipt.
Al thing of male kynde that openeth the wombe schal be myn, of alle lyuynge beestis, as wel of oxun, as of scheep, it schal be myn.
Thou schalt ayenbie with a scheep the firste gendrid of an asse, ellis if thou yyuest not prijs therfor, it schal be slayn. Thou schalt ayenbie the firste gendrid of thi sones; nether thou schalt appere voide in my siyt.
Sixe daies thou schalt worche, the seuenthe day thou schalt ceesse to ere and repe.
Thou schalt make to thee the solempnyte of woukis in the firste thingis of fruytis of thi ripe corn of wheete, and the solempnyte, whanne alle thingis ben gadrid in to bernes, whanne the tyme `of yeer cometh ayen.
Ech male kynde of thee schal appere in thre tymes of the yeer in the siyt of the Lord Almyyti, thi God of Israel.
For whanne Y schal take awei folkis fro thi face, and Y schal alarge thi termes, noon schal sette tresouns to thi lond, while thou stiest and apperist in the siyt of thi Lord God, thries in the yeer.
Thou schalt not offre on sour dow the blood of my sacrifice, nethir ony thing of the slayn sacrifice of the solempnyte of fase schal abide in the morewtid.
Thou schalt offre in the hows of thi Lord God the firste of the fruytis of thi lond. Thou schalt not sethe a kide in the mylk of his modir.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Write thou these wordis, bi whiche Y smoot a boond of pees, bothe with thee and with Israel.
Therfor Moises was there with the Lord bi fourti daies and bi fourti nyytis, he eet not breed, and drank not watir; and he wroot in tablys ten wordis of the boond of pees.
And whanne Moises cam doun fro the hil of Synai, he helde twei tablis of witnessyng, and he wiste not that his face was horned of the felouschipe of Goddis word.
Forsothe Aaron and the sones of Israel sien Moises face horned,
and thei dredden to neiye niy, and thei weren clepid of hym, `and thei turneden ayen, as wel Aaron as the princis of the synagoge; and after that Moises spak, thei camen to hym,
yhe alle the sones of Israel; to whiche Moises comaundide alle thingis, whiche he hadde herd of the Lord in the hil of Synai.
And whanne the wordis weren fillid, he puttide a veil on his face;
and he entride to the Lord, and spak with hym, and dide awey that veil, til he yede out; and thanne he spak to the sones of Israel alle thingis, that weren comaundid to hym;
whiche sien that the face of Moyses goynge out was horned, but eft he hilide his face, if ony tyme he spak to hem.
Therfor whanne al the cumpanye of the sones of Israel was gaderid, Moises seide to hem, These thingis it ben, whiche the Lord comaundide to be doon.
Sixe daies ye schulen do werk, the seuenthe dai schal be hooli to you, the sabat and reste of the Lord; he that doith werk in the sabat schal be slayn.
Ye schulen not kyndle fier in alle youre dwellyng places bi the `dai of sabat.
And Moises seide to al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, This is the word which the Lord comaundide, and seide,
Departe ye at you the firste fruytis to the Lord; ech wilful man and of redi wille offre tho to the Lord, gold, and siluer, and bras,
and iacynct, and purpur, and reed selk twies died, and bijs, heeris of geet,
and skynnys of rammes maad reed, and of iacynt,

stoonus of onochyn and gemmes, to the ournyng of the `cloth on the schuldris, and of the racional.
Who euer of you is wijs, come he, and make that, that the Lord comaundide,
that is, the tabernacle, and the roof therof, and the hilyng; ryngis, and bildyngis of tablis, with barris, stakis, and foundementis;
the arke, and barris; the propiciatorie, and the veil, which is hangid byfore it;
the bord with barris, and vesselis, and with looues of settyng forth;
the candilstike to susteyne liytis, the vesselis, and lanternes therof, and oile to the nurschyngis of fyris; the auter of encense, and the barris;
the oile of anoyntyng, and encense of swete smellynge spiceries; the tente at the dore of the tabernacle;

the clothis, whose vss is in `the seruyce of seyntuarie; the clothis of Aaron bischop, and of hise sones, that thei be set in preesthod to me.
And al the multitude of the sones of Israel yede out of `the siyt of Moises,
and offride with moost redi soule and deuout the firste thingis to the Lord, to make the werk of the tabernacle of witnessyng, what euer was nedeful to the ournyng, and to hooli clothis.
Men and wymmen yauen bies of the armes, and eeryngis, ryngis, and ournementis of `the arm niy the hond; ech goldun vessel was departid in to the yiftis of the Lord.
If ony man hadde iacynt, and purpur, and `reed selk twies died, bijs, and the heeris of geet, skynnes of rammes maad reed, and of iacynt,

But also wymmen tauyt yauen tho thingis, whiche thei hadden spunne, iacynt, purpur, and vermyloun,
and bijs, and the heeris of geet; and yauen alle thingis by her owne fre wille.
Forsothe princes offeriden stoonys of onychyn and iemmes, to the `cloth on the schuldris, and to the racional, and swete smellynge spiceries,
and oyle to the liytis to be ordeyned, and to make redi oynement, and to make the encense of swettist odour.
Alle men and wymmen offeriden yiftis with deuout soule, that the werkis schulden be maad, whiche the Lord comaundide bi the hond of Moyses; alle the sones of Israel halewiden wilful thingis to the Lord.
And Moises seide to the sones of Israel, Lo! the Lord hath clepid Beseleel bi name, the sone of Hury, sone of Hur, of the lynage of Juda;
and the Lord hath fillid hym with the spirit of God, of wisdom, and of vndurstondyng, and of kunnyng, and with al doctryn,
to fynde out and to make werk in gold, and siluer, and bras, and in stoonys to be grauun,
and in werk of carpentrie; what euer thing may be foundun craftili, the Lord yaf in his herte;
and the Lord clepide Ooliab, the sone of Achymasech, of the lynage of Dan;
the Lord tauyte bothe `with wisdom, that thei make the werkis of carpenter, of steynour, and of broiderere, of iacynt, and purpur, and of `reed selk, and of bijs, and that thei make alle thingis, and fynde alle newe thingis.
Therfor Beseleel, and Ooliab, and ech wijs man, to whiche the Lord yaf wisdom and vndurstondyng, that thei kouden worche crafteli, maden thingis that weren nedeful in to vsis of seyntuarie, and whiche the Lord comaundide to be maad.
And whanne Moises hadde clepid hem, and ech lerned man, to whom the Lord hadde youe wisdom and kunnyng, and whiche profriden hem bi her wille to make werk,
he bitook to hem alle the yiftis of the sones of Israel. And whanne thei weren bisi in the werk ech dai, the puple offride auowis eerli.
Wherfor the werkmen weren compellid to come,
and thei seiden to Moises, The puple offrith more than is nedeful.
Therfor Moises comaundide to be cried bi the vois of a criere, Nether man nether womman offre more ony thing in the werk of seyntuarie; and so it was ceessid fro yiftis to be offrid, for the thingis offrid sufficiden,
and weren ouer abundant.
And alle wise men in herte to fille the werk of the tabernacle maden ten curteyns of bijs foldid ayen, and of iacynct, and purpur, and of reed selk twies died, bi dyuerse werk, and bi the craft of many colouris.
Of whiche curteyns oon hadde in lengthe eiyte and twenti cubitis, and foure cubitis in breede; o mesure was of alle curteyns.
And he ioynede fyue curteyns oon to anothir, and he couplide othere fyue to hem silf to gidere;
and he made handlis of iacynt in the hemme of o curteyn on euer either side,
and in lijk maner in the hemme of the tother curteyn, that the handlis schulen comen to gidere ayens hem silf, and schulen be ioyned togider;
wherfor he yettide also fifti goldun serclis, that schulen `bite the handlis of curteyns; and o tabernacle was maad.
`He made also enleuene saies of the heeris of geet, to hile the roof of the tabernacle;
o saie hadde thretti cubitis in lengthe, foure cubitis in breede; alle the saies weren of o mesure;
of whiche saies he ioynede fyue bi hem silf, and sixe othere bi hem silf.
And he made fifti handlis in the hemme of o say, and fifti in the hemme of the tother say, that tho schulden be ioyned to hem silf to gidere; and he made fifti bokelis of bras bi whiche
the roof was fastned to gidere, that oon hilyng were maad of alle the saies.
He made also an hilyng of the tabernacle of the skynnes of rammes maad reed, and another veil aboue of skynnes of iacynt.
He made also stondynge tablis of the tabernacle of the trees of Sechym;
the lengthe of o table was of ten cubitis, and the breede helde o cubit and an half.
Twey dentyngis weren bi ech table, that the oon schulde be ioyned to the tother; so he made in al the tablis of the tabernacle.
Of whiche tablis twenti weren at the mydday coost ayens the south,

And at the coost of the tabernacle that biholdith to the north he made twenti tablis,

Forsothe ayens the west he made sixe tablis,
and tweyne othere tablis bi ech corner of the tabernacle bihinde,

He made also in the entryng of the tabernacle a tent of iacynt, and purpur, and reed selk `and bijs foldid ayen bi the werk of a broydreie.
And he made fyue pileris with her heedis, whiche he hilide with gold, and he yetide the brasun foundementis `of tho, whiche he hilide with gold.
Forsothe Beseleel made also an arke of the trees of Sechym, hauynge twey cubitis and an half in lengthe, and a cubit and an half in breede; forsothe the hiynesse was of o cubit and an half; and he clothide the arke with purest gold, with ynne and without forth.
And he made to it a goldun coroun `bi cumpas,

and hilynge the propiciatorie, and biholdynge hem silf togidere and that.
He made also a boord of `the trees of Sechym, in the lengthe of twey cubitis, and in the breede of o cubit, whiche boord hadde `a cubit and an half in heiythe.
And he cumpaside the boord with clenneste gold, and made to it a goldun brynke bi cumpas;
and he made to that brynke a goldun coroun, rasid bitwixe of foure fyngris; and on the same coroun he made anothir goldun coroun.
Also he yetide foure goldun serclis whiche he settide in foure corneris,

And he made tho barris of the trees of Sechym, and cumpasside tho with gold.
And he made vesselis to dyuerse vsis of the boord, vessels of vynegre, violis, and litle cuppis, and censeris of pure gold, in whiche the fletynge sacrifices schulen be offrid.
And he made a candilstike, betun out with hamer, of clenneste gold, of whos barre yerdis, cuppis, and litle rundelis and lilies camen forth;

Sotheli in that barre weren foure cuppis, in the maner of a note, and litle rundels and lilies weren bi alle cuppis;
and litle rundels vndur twei schaftis, bi thre placis, whiche to gidre be maad sixe schaftis comynge forth of o barre;
therfor and the litle rundels, and schaftis therof, weren alle betun out with hamer, of pureste gold.
He made also seuene lanternes, with her `snytyng tongis, and the vessels where `tho thingis, that ben snytid out, ben quenchid, of clennest gold.
The candilstike with alle his vessels weiyede a talent of gold.
He made also the auter of encense, of trees of Sechym, hauynge a cubit bi square, and twei cubitis in heiythe, of whos corneris camen forth hornes.
And he clothide it with clenneste gold, and the gridele, and wallis, and hornes;

And in to vsis therof he made redi of bras dyuerse vessels, caudruns, tongis, fleischhokis, hokis, and `resseittis of firis.
He made also the brasun gridile therof, `bi the maner of a net, and a `panne for colis vndur it, in the myddis of the auter.
And he yetide foure ryngis, by so many endis of the gridile, to putte in the barris to bere;
and he made tho same barris of the trees of Sechym, and hilide with platis of bras.
And ledde in to the serclis that stonden forth in the sidis of the auter. Forsothe thilke auter was not sad, but holowe of the bildyngis of tablis, and voide with ynne.
He made also a `greet waischyng vessel of bras, with his foundement, of the myrours of wymmen that wakiden in the `greet street of the tabernacle.
And he made the greet street, in whose south coost weren tentis of bijs foldid ayen, of an hundrid cubitis, twenti brasun pilers with her foundementis,

Forsothe in that coost that biholdith the west weren tentis of fyfty cubitis, ten brasun pilers with her foundementis, and the `heedis of pilers, and al the grauyng of werk, weren of siluer.

The foundementis of pilers weren of bras; forsothe the heedis of tho pilers, with alle her grauyngis, weren of siluer; but also he clothide with siluer tho pilers of the greet street.
And in the entryng therof he made a tente, bi `werk of broiderie, of iacynt, purpur, vermyloun, and of bijs foldid ayen, which tente hadde twenti cubitis in lengthe, and the heiythe was of fyue cubitis, bi the mesure which alle the tentis of the greet street hadden.
Forsothe the pylers in the entryng weren foure, with brasun foundementis, and the heedis of tho pilers and grauyngis weren of siluer;
and he made brasun stakis of the tabernacle, and of the greet street, bi cumpas.
These ben the instrumentis of the tabernacle of witnessyng, that ben noumbrid, bi the comaundement of Moises, in the cerymonyes of Leuytis, bi the hond of Ithamar, sone of Aaron, preest.
Whiche instrumentis Beseleel, sone of Huri, sone of Hur, of the lynage of Juda, fillide; for the Lord comaundide bi Moises,

Al the gold that was spendid in the werk of seyntuarie, and that was offrid in yiftis, was of `nyne and twenti talentis, and of seuene hundrid and thretti siclis, at the mesure of seyntuarie.
Forsothe it was offrid of hem that passiden to noumbre fro twenti yeer and aboue, of sixe hundrid and thre thousand, and fyue hundrid and fifty of armed men.

Forsothe of iacynt, and purpur, vermyloun, and bijs, he made clothis, in whiche Aaron was clothid, whanne he mynystride in hooli thingis, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
Therfor he made the `cloth on the schuldris of gold, iacynt, and purpur, and of reed selk twies died,

And he made redi twei `stonys of onychyn, boundun and closid in gold, and grauun bi the craft of worchere in iemmys, with the names of the sones of Israel; sixe names in o stoon, and sixe in the tother stoon, bi the ordre of her birthe.
And he settide tho stoonus in the sidis of the `clooth on the schuldris, in to a memorial of the sones of Israel, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He made also the racional, `by werk of broiderie, bi the werk of the `cloth on the schuldris, of gold, iacynt, purpur, and reed selk twies died, and of biis foldid ayen; he made the racional foure cornerid,

And settide thereynne foure ordris of iemmes; in the firste ordre was sardius, topazius, smaragdus; in the secounde was carbuncle,

These acordiden so to hem silf, bothe bifore and bihynde, that the `cloth on the schuldris, and the racional,

Thei maden also a plate of hooli worschipyng, of pureste gold, and thei writeden therynne bi werk of a worchere in iemmes, The hooli of the Lord.
And thei bounden it with the mytre bi a lace of iacynt, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
Therfor al the werk of the tabernacle, and the hilyng of the witnessyng, was parformed; and the sones of Israel diden alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises.
And thei offeriden the tabernacle, and the roof, and al the purtenaunce, ryngis, tablis, barris, pileris, and foundementis;

Also the sones of Israel offriden the clothis whiche the prestis, that is, Aaron and hise sones, vsen in the seyntuarie,
as the Lord comaundide.
And aftir that Moises siy alle tho thingis fillid, he blesside hem.
And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide,
In the firste monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, thou schalt reise the tabernacle of witnessyng.
And thou schalt sette the arke therynne, and thou schalt leeue a veil bifore it.
And whanne the bord is borun yn, thou schalt sette ther onne tho thingis, that ben comaundid iustli. The candilstike schal stonde with hise lanternes,
and the goldun auter, where ynne encense is brent bifor the arke of witnessyng. Thou schalt sette a tente in the entryng of the tabernacle;
and bifor it the auter of brent sacrifice,
the `waischyng vessel bitwixe the auter and the tabernacle, which `waischyng vessel thou schalt fille with water.
And thou schalt cumpas the greet street, and the entryng ther of with tentis.
And whanne thou hast take oyle of anoyntyng, thou schalt anoynte the tabernacle, with hise vessels, that tho be halewid;

And thou schalt present Aaron and hise sones to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and, whanne thei ben `waischid in water, thou schalt clothe hem with hooli clothis, that thei mynystre to me, and that the anoyntyng of hem profite in to euerlastynge preesthod.
And Moises dide alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide.
Therfor in the firste monethe of the secunde yeer, in the firste dai of the monethe, the tabernacle was set.
And Moises reiside it, and settide the tablis, and foundementis, and barris, and he ordeynede pilers;
and `spredde abrood the roof on the tabernacle, and puttide an hilyng aboue, as the Lord comaundide.
He puttide also the witnessyng in the arke, and he settide barris with ynne, and Goddis answeryng place aboue.
And whanne he hadde brouyt the arke in to the tabernacle, he hangide a veil bifor it, that he schulde fille the comaundement of the Lord.
He settide also the boord in the tabernacle of witnessyng, at the north coost, without the veil,
and he ordeynede the looues of settyng forth bifore, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He settide also the candilstike in the tabernacle of witnessyng, euene ayens the boord,

He puttide also the goldun auter vndur the roof of witnessyng,

Also he ordeynede the `waischyng vessel, bitwixe the tabernacle of witnessyng and the auter, and fillide it with watir.
And Moises, and Aaron, and his sones, waischiden her hondis and feet,
whanne thei entriden into the roof of boond of pees, and neiyeden to the auter, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
He reiside also the greet street, bi the cumpas of the tabernacle and of the auter, and settyde a tente in the entryng therof. Aftir that alle thingis weren perfitli maad,
a cloude hilide the tabernacle of witnessyng, and the glorie of the Lord fillide it;
nether Moyses myyte entre in to the tabernacle of the boond of pees, while the cloude hilide alle thingis, and the maieste of the Lord schynede, for the cloude hilide alle thingis.
If ony tyme the cloude lefte the tabernacle, the sones of Israel yeden forth bi her cumpanyes;
if the cloude hangide aboue, thei dwelliden in the same place;
for the cloude of the Lord restide on the tabernacle bi dai, and fier in the nyyt, in the siyt of the puplis of Israel, bi alle her dwellyngis.
FORSOTHE the Lord clepide Moyses, and spak to him fro the tabernacle of witnessyng, `and seide,
Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, A man of you, that offrith to the Lord a sacrifice of beestis, that is, of oxun and of scheep, and offrith slayn sacrifices, if his offryng is brent sacrifice,
and of the droue of oxun, he schal offre a male beeste without wem at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, to make the Lord plesid to hym.
And he schal sette hondis on the heed of the sacrifice, and it schal be acceptable, and profityng in to clensyng of hym.
And he schal offre a calf bifor the Lord, and the sones of Aaron, preestis, schulen offre the blood ther of, and thei schulen schede bi the cumpas of the auter, which is bifor the dore of the tabernacle.
And whanne the skyn of the sacrifice is drawun awei, thei schulen kitte the membris in to gobetis;
and thei schulen put vndur in the auter fier, and thei schulen make an heep of wode bifore; and thei schulen ordeyne aboue
`the trees tho thingis that ben kit, that is, the heed, and alle thingis that cleuen to the mawe,
whanne the entrailis and feet ben waischid with watir; and the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, and swete odour to the Lord.
That if the offryng is of litle beestis, a brent sacrifice of scheep, ethir of geet, he schal offre a male beeste with out wem,
and he schal offre at the side of the auter that biholdith to the north, bifore the Lord. Sotheli the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof on the auter `bi cumpas,
and thei schulen departe the membris, the heed, and alle thingis that cleuen to the mawe, and thei schulen putte on the trees, vndur whiche the fier schal be set;
sotheli thei schulen waische in watir the entrailis and feet; and the preest schal brenne alle thingis offrid on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, and swettest odour to the Lord.
Forsothe if the offryng of brent sacrifice to the Lord is of briddis, of turtlis, and of culuer briddis,
the preest schal offre it at the auter; and whanne the heed is writhun to the necke, and the place of the wounde is brokun, he schal make the blood renne doun on the brenke of the auter.
Sotheli he schal caste forth the litil bladdir of the throte, and fetheris bisidis the auter, at the eest coost, in the place in which the aischis ben wont to be sched out;
and he schal breke the wyngis therof, and he schal not kerue, nether he schal departe it with yrun; and he schal brenne it on the auter, whanne fier is set vndur the trees; it is a brent sacrifice, and an offryng of swete odour to the Lord.
Whanne a soule offrith an offryng of sacrifice to the Lord, flour of wheete schal be his offring. And he schal schede oile ther onne,
and he schal putte encense, and he schal bere to the sones of Aaron, preest, of whiche sones oon schal take an handful of `flour of whete, and of oile, and alle the encense; and he schal putte a memorial on the auter, in to swettest odour to the Lord.
Forsothe that that `is residue of the sacrifice schal be Aarons and hise sones, the hooli of hooli thingis of offryngis to the Lord.
Forsothe whanne thou offrist a sacrifice bakun in an ouene of whete flour, that is, loouys without sour dow, spreynd with oile, and therf breed sodun in watir, bawmed with oile;
if thin offryng is `of a friyng panne, of wheete flour spreynd with oile and without sour dow,
thou schalt departe it in smale partis, and thou schalt schede oile ther onne.
Ellis if the sacrifice is of a gridele, euenli the whete flour schal be spreynd with oile;
which whete flour thou schalt offre to the Lord, and schalt bitake in the hondis of the preest.
And whanne he hath offrid it, he schal take a memorial of the sacrifice, and he schal brenne it on the auter, in to `odour of swetnesse to the Lord.
Sotheli what euer thing `is residue, it schal be Aarons and hise sones, the hooly of hooli thingis of the offryngis to the Lord.
Ech offryng which is offrid to the Lord, schal be without sour dow, nether ony thing of sour dow, and of hony, schal be brent in the sacrifice of the Lord.
Ye schulen offre oneli the firste fruytis of tho, and yiftis; sotheli tho schulen not be put on the auter, in to odour of swetnesse.
Whateuer thing of sacrifice thou schalt offre, thou schalt make it sauery with salt, nether thou schalt take awey the salt of the boond of pees of thi God fro thi sacrifice; in ech offryng thou schalt offre salt.
Forsothe if thou offrist a yifte of the firste thingis of thi fruytis to the Lord, of `eeris of corn yit grene, thou schalt seenge tho in fier, and thou schalt breke in the maner of seedis; and so thou schalt offre thi firste fruytis to the Lord,
and thou schalt schede oyle theronne, and schalt putte encense, for it is the offryng of the Lord.
Of which the preest schal brenne, in to mynde of the yifte, a part of the `seedis brokun, and of oyle, and al the encense.
That if his offryng is a sacrifice of pesible thingis, and he wole offre of oxun, he schal offre bifore the Lord a male, ether a female, without wem.
And he schal sette hond on the heed of his sacrifice, that schal be offrid in the entryng of the tabernacle; and the sones of Aaron preest schulen schede the blood bi the cumpas of the auter.
And thei schulen offre of the sacrifice of pesible thingis in to offryng to the Lord, the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis, and what euer thing of fatnesse is with ynne;
thei schulen offre twey kydeneris, with the fatnesse bi which the guttis clepid ylyon ben hilid, and the calle of the lyuer with the litle reynes.
And thei schulen brenne tho on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, whanne fier is put vndur the trees, in to offryng of swettest odour to the Lord.
Sotheli if his offryng is of scheep, and a sacrifice of pesible thingis, whether he offrith a male ether a female, tho schulen be without wem.
If he offrith a lombe bifor the Lord,
he schal sette his hond on the heed of his sacrifice, that schal be offrid in the porche of the tabernacle of witnessyng; and the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof bi `the cumpas of the auter.
And thei schulen offre of the sacrifice of pesible thingis a sacrifice to the Lord, the innere fatnesse,
and al the tail with the reynes, and the fatnesse that hilith the wombe, and alle the entrailis, and euer eithir litil reyne, with the fatnesse which is bisidis the `guttis clepid ylion, and the calle of the mawe, with the litle reynes.
And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to the fedyng of fier, and of the offryng to the Lord.
If his offryng is a geet, and he offrith it to the Lord,
he schal sette his hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it in to the entryng of the tabernacle of witnessyng; and the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof bi the cumpas of the auter.
And thei schulen take therof, in to `the fedyng of the Lordis fier, the fatnesse that hilith the wombe, and that hilith alle the entrailis,
and twei litle reynes with the calle which is on tho bisidis ilion, and the fatnesse of the mawe, with the entrails that cleuen to the litle reynes.
And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to the fedyng of fier, and of swettest odour; al the fatnesse schal be the Lordis,
by euerlastynge riyt in generaciouns, and in alle youre dwellyng placis, nether in ony maner ye schulen ete blood, nethir fatnesse.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
Whanne a soule hath do synne bi ignoraunce, and hath do ony thing of alle comaundementis `of the Lord, whiche he comaundide that tho schulen not be don; if a preest which is anoyntid,

And he schal brynge it to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, bifor the Lord, and he schal sette hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it to the Lord.
And he schal take vp of the blood `of the calf, and schal brynge it in to the tabernacle of witnessyng.
And whanne he hath dippid the fyngir in to the blood, he schal sprenge it seuen sithis bifor the Lord, ayens the veil of the seyntuarie.
And he schal putte of the same blood on the corners of the auter of encense moost acceptable to the Lord, which auter is in the tabernacle of witnessyng; sotheli he schal schede al the `tother blood in to the foundement of the auter of brent sacrifice in the entryng of the tabernacle.
And he schal offre for synne the ynnere fatnesse of the calf, as well it that hilith the entrails, as alle thingis that ben with ynne,
twei litle reynes, and the calle, which is on tho bisidis ilion, and the fatnesse of the mawe,
with the litle reines, as it is offrid of the calf of the sacrifice of pesible thingis; and he schal brenne tho on the auter of brent sacrifice.
Sotheli he schal bere out of the castels the skyn, and alle the fleischis, with the heed, and feet, and entrails,
and dung, and the `residue bodi in to a clene place, where aischis ben wont to be sched out; and he schal brenne tho on the heep of trees, whiche schulen be brent in the place of aischis sched out.
That if al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel knowith not, and doith by vnkunnyng that that is ayens the comaundement of the Lord,
and aftirward vndirstondith his synne, it schal offre a calf for synne, and it schal brynge the calf to the dore of the tabernacle.
And the eldere men of the puple schulen sette hondis on the heed therof bifor the Lord; and whanne the calf is offrid in the siyt of the Lord,
the preest which is anoyntid schal bere ynne of his blood in to the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and whanne the fyngur `is dippid, he schal sprenge seuen sithis ayens the veil.
And he schal putte of the same blood in the hornes of the auter, which is bifor the Lord in the tabernacle of witnessyng; sotheli he schal schede the `residue blood bisidis the foundement of the auter of brent sacrifice, which is in the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng.
And he schal take al the fatnesse therof, and schal brenne it on the auter;
and so he schal do also of this calf, as he dide also bifor; and whanne the prest schal preye for hem, the Lord schal be merciful.
Forsothe he schal bere out thilke calf, and schal brenne it, as also the formere calf, for it is for the synne of the multitude.
If the prince synneth, and doith bi ignoraunce o thing of many, which is forbodun in the lawe of the Lord,
and aftirward vndirstondith his synne, he schal offre to the Lord a sacrifice, a `buk of geet, `that hath no wem;
and he schal sette his hond on the heed therof. And whanne he hath offrid it in the place, where brent sacrifice is wont to be slayn, bifor the Lord, for it is for synne;
the preest schal dippe the fyngur in the blood of sacrifice for synne, and he schal touche the corneris of the auter of brent sacrifice, and he schal schede the `residue blood at the foundement therof.
Sotheli the preest schal brenne the innere fatnesse aboue the auter, as it is wont to be doon in the sacrifice of pesible thingis, and the preest schal preye for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym.
That if a soule of the puple of the lond synneth bi ignoraunce, that he do ony thing of these that ben forbodun in the lawe of the Lord, and trespassith,
and knowith his synne, he schal offre a geet without wem;
and he schal sette hond on the heed of the sacrifice which is for synne, and he schal offre it in the place of brent sacrifice.
And the preest schal take of the blood on his fyngur, and he schal touche the hornes of the auter of brent sacryfice, and he schal schede the residue at the foundement therof.
Sotheli he schal take a wei al the ynnere fatnesse, as it is wont to be don a wei of the sacrifices of pesible thingis, and he schal brenne it on the auter, in to odour of swetnesse to the Lord; and the preest schal preye for hym, and it schal be foryouun to hym.
Sotheli if he offrith of litle beestis a sacrifice for synne, that is,
a scheep without wem, he schal putte the hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it in the place where the beest of brent sacrifices ben wont to be slayn.
And the preest schal take of the blood therof in his fyngur, and he schal touche the hornes of the autir of brent sacrifice, and he schal schede the residue at the foundement therof.
And he schal do awey al the ynnere fatnesse as the innere fatnesse of the ram which is offrid for pesible thingis, is wont to be don a wei, and he schal brenne it on the auter of encense of the Lord; and the preest schal preye for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym.
If a soule synneth, and hereth the vois of a swerere, and is witnesse, `for ether he siy, ether `is witynge, if he schewith not, he schal bere his synne.
A persone that touchith ony vnclene thing, ether which is slayn of a beeste, ether is deed bi it silf, ether touchith ony other crepynge beeste, and foryetith his vnclennesse, he is gilti, and trespassith.
And if he touchith ony thing of the vnclennesse of man, bi al the vnclennesse bi which he is wont to be defoulid, and he foryetith, and knowith afterward, he schal be suget to trespas.
A soule that swerith, and bryngith forth with hise lippis, that it schulde do ether yuel, ether wel, and doith not, and confermeth the same thing with an ooth, ethir with a word, and foryetith, and aftirward vndirstondith his trespas, do it penaunce for synne,
and offre it of the flockis a femal lomb, ethir a goet;
and the preest schal preie for hym, and for his synne.
But if he may not offre a beeste, offre he twei turtlis, ethir `briddis of culuers to the Lord, oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice.
And he schal yyue tho to the preest, which schal offre the firste for synne, and schal folde ayen the heed therof to the wengis, so that it cleue to the necke, and be not `brokyn outirli.
And the preest schal sprynge the wal of the auter, of the blood therof; sotheli what euer `is residue, he schal make to droppe doun at the `foundement of the auter, for it is for synne.
Sotheli he schal brenne the tother brid in to brent sacrifice, as it is wont to be doon; and the preest schal preie for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym.
That if his hond mai not offre twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, he schal offre for his synne the tenthe part of ephi of wheete flour; he schal not putte oile `in to it, nether he schal putte ony thing of encense, for it is for synne.
And he schal yyue it to the preest, which preest schal take vp an handful therof, and schal brenne on the auter, in to mynde of hym that offeride,
and the preest schal preie for hym, and schal clense; forsothe he schal have the tother part in yifte.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, If a soule brekith cerymonyes bi errour, and synneth in these thingis that ben halewid to the Lord, it schal offre for his trespas a ram without wem of the flockis, that may be bouyt for twey siclis, bi the weiyte of the seyntuarie.
And he schal restore that harm that he dide, and he schal putte the fyuethe part aboue, and schal yyue to the preest, which preest schal preye for hym, and offre the ram, and it schal be foryouun to hym.
A soule that synneth bi ignoraunce, and doith oon of these thingis that ben forbodun in the lawe of the Lord, and is gilti of synne, and vndirstondith his wickidnesse,
it schal offre to the preest a ram without wem of the flockis, bi the mesure of estymacioun of synne; and the preest schal preye for hym, for he dide vnwytynge, and it schal be foryouun to him,
for by errour he trespasside ayens the Lord.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, A soule that synneth, and dispisith the Lord, and denyeth to his neiybore a thing bitakun to kepyng, that was bitakun to his feith, ethir takith maisterfuli a thing bi violence, ether makith fals chaleng,
ether fyndith a thing lost, and denyeth ferthermore and forswerith, and doth ony other thing of manye in whiche thingis men ben wont to do synne,
`if it is conuict of the gilt,
it schal yelde hool alle thingis whiche it wolde gete bi fraude, and ferthermore the fyuethe part to the lord, to whom it dide harm.
Sotheli for his synne it schal offre a ram vnwemmed of the floc, and it schal yyue that ram to the preest, bi the valu and mesure of the trespas;
and the preest schal preie for hym bifor the Lord, and it schal be foryouun to hym, for alle thingis whiche he synnede in doyng.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Comaunde thou to Aaron, and to hise sones, This is the lawe of brent sacrifice; it schal be brent in the auter al nyyt til the morewe; fier that is youun fro heuene schal be of the same auter.
The preest schal be clothid with a coote, and `pryuy lynnun clothis; and he schal take awei the aischis, which the fier deuourynge brente, and he schal putte bisidis the auter;
and he schal be spuylid of the formere clothis, and he schal be clothid with other, and schal bere aischis out of the castels, and in a moost clene place he schal make tho to be wastid til to a deed sparcle.
Forsothe fier schal brenne euere in the auter, which fier the preest schal nurische, puttynge trees vndur, in the morewtid bi ech dai; and whanne brent sacrifice is put aboue, the preest schal brenne the ynnere fatnessis of pesible thingis.
This is euerlastynge fier, that schal neuer faile in the auter.
This is the lawe of sacrifice, and of fletynge offryngis, whiche `the sones of Aaron schulen offre bifore the Lord, and bifor the auter.
The preest schal take an handful of wheete flour, which is spreynd with oile, and al the encense which is put on the wheete flour, and he schal brenne it in the auter, in to mynde of swettist odour to the Lord.
Forsothe Aaron with hise sones schal ete the tother part of wheete flour, without sour dow; and he schal ete in the hooli place of the greet street of the tabernacle.
Sotheli herfor it schal not be `diyt with sour dow, for a part therof is offrid in to encense of the Lord; it schal be hooli `of the noumbre of holi thingis, as for synne and for trespas.
Malis oonli of the kynrede of Aaron schulen ete it; it is a lawful thing and euerlastynge in youre generaciouns, of the sacrifice of the Lord; ech man that touchith tho schal be halewyd.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, This is the offryng of Aaron, and of hise sones, which thei owen offre to the Lord in the day of her anoyntyng ; thei schulen offre the tenthe part of ephi of wheete flour, in euerlastynge sacrifice, the myddis therof in the morewtid, and the myddis therof in the euentid;
which schal be spreynt with oile in the friyng panne, and schal be fried.
Sotheli the preest which is successour to the fadir `bi riyt, schal offre it hoot, in to sweteste odour to the Lord; and al it schal be brent in the auter.
For al the sacrifice of preestis schal be wastid with fier, nether ony man schal ete therof.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Spek thou to Aaron and to hise sones, This is the lawe of sacrifice for synne; it schal be offrid bifor the Lord, in the place where brent sacrifice is offrid; it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
The preest that offrith it, schal ete it in the hooli place, in the greet street of the tabernacle.
What euer thing schal touche the fleischis therof, it schal be halewid; if a cloth is bispreynt of the blood therof, it schal be waischun in the hooli place.
Sotheli the erthun vessel, in which it is sodun, schal be brokun; that if the vessel is of bras, it schal be scourid, and `schal be waischun with watir.
Ech male of preestis kyn schal ete of the fleischis therof; for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
Sotheli the sacrifice which is slayn for synne, whos blood is borun in to the tabernacle of witnessyng to clense in the seyntuarie, schal not be etun, but it schal be brent in fier.
And this is the lawe of sacrifice for trespas; it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
Therfor where brent sacrifice is offrid, also the sacrifice for trespas schal be slayn; the blood therof schal be sched bi the cumpas of the auter.
Thei schulen offre the tail therof, and the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis,
the twei litle reynes, and the fatnesse which is bisidis ilioun, and the calle of the mawe, with the litle reynes.
And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter; it is encense of the Lord, for trespas.
Ech male of the preestis kyn schal ete these fleischis in the hooli place, for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
As a sacrifice is offrid for synne, so and for trespas, o lawe schal be of euer eithir sacrifice; it schal perteyne to the preest, that offrith it.
The preest that offrith the beeste of brent sacrifice, schal haue the skyn therof.
And ech sacrifice of wheete flour, which is bakun in an ouene, and what euer is maad redi in a gridile, ethir in a friyng panne, it schal be that preestis, of whom it is offrid,
whether it is spreynt with oile, ethir is drye. To alle the sones of Aaron euene mesure schal be departyd, `to ech `bi hem silf.
This is the lawe of `the sacrifice of pesible thingis, which is offrid to the Lord.
If the offryng is for doyng of thankyngis, thei schulen offre looues without sour dow spreynt with oile, and `therf looues sodun in watir, that ben anoyntid with oile; and thei schulen offre wheete flour bakun, and thinne looues spreynt to gidere with the medlyng of oile.
Also thei schulen offre `looues diyt with sour dow, with the sacrifice of thankyngis which is offrid for pesible thingis;
of whiche o loof schal be offrid to the Lord for the firste fruytis, and it schal be the preestis that schal schede the blood of the sacrifice,
whose fleischis schulen be etun in the same dai, nether ony thing of tho schal dwelle til the morewtid.
If a man offrith a sacrifice bi a vow, ethir bi fre wille, it schal be etun in lijk maner in the same dai; but also if ony thing dwellith `in to the morew, it is leueful to ete it;
sotheli fier schal waaste, whateuer thing the thridde day schal fynde.
If ony man etith in the thridde dai of the fleischis of sacrifice of pesible thingis, his offryng schal be maad voide, nethir it schal profite to the offerere; but rather whateuer soule defoulith hym silf with suche mete, he schal be gilti of `brekyng of the lawe.
Fleisch that touchith ony vnclene thing, schal not be etun, but it schal be brent bi fier; he that is clene, schal ete it.
A pollutid soule, that etith of the fleischis of the sacrifice of pesible thingis, which is offrid to the Lord, schal perische fro hise puplis.
And he that touchith vnclennesse of man, ether of beeste, ether of alle thing that may defoule, and etith of suche fleischis, schal perische fro hise puplis.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Ye schulen not ete the ynnere fatnesse of a scheep, of an oxe, and of a geet;
ye schulen haue in to dyuerse vsis the ynnere fatnesse of a carkeis deed by it silf, and of that beeste which is takun of a rauenus beeste.
If ony man etith the ynnere fatnesse, that owith to be offrid in to encense of the Lord, he schal perische fro his puple.
Also ye schulen not take in mete the blood of ony beeste, as wel of briddis as of beestis;
ech man that etith blood schal perische fro his puplis.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, He that offrith a sacrifice of pesible thingis to the Lord, offre togidere also a sacrifice, that is, fletynge offryngis therof.
He schal holde in the hondis the ynnere fatnesse of the sacrifice, and the brest; and whanne he hath halewid bothe offrid to the Lord, he schal yyue to the preest,
which schal brenne the ynnere fatnesse on the auter; sotheli the brest schal be Aarons and hise sones;
and the riyt schuldur of the sacrifices of pesible thingis schal turne in to the firste fruytis of the preest.
He that of Aarons sones offrith the blood, and the ynnere fatnesse, schal haue also the riyt schuldur in his porcioun.
For Y haue take fro the sones of Israel the brest of reisyng, and the schuldur of departyng, of the pesible sacrifices `of hem, and Y haue youe to Aaron the preest and to hise sones, bi euerlastynge lawe, of al the puple of Israel.
This is the anoyntyng of Aaron, and of hise sones, in the cerymonyes of the Lord, in the dai where ynne Moises offride hem that thei schulden be set in preesthod,
and whiche thingis the Lord comaundide to be youun to hem of the sones of Israel, bi euerlastynge religioun in her generaciouns.
This is the lawe of brent sacrifice, and of sacrifice for synne, and for trespas, and for halewyng, and for the sacrifices of pesible thingis;
which lawe the Lord ordeynede to Moises in the hil of Synay, whanne he comaundide to the sones of Israel that thei schulden offre her offryngis to the Lord, in the deseert of Synay.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Take thou Aaron with hise sones,
`the clothes of hem, and the oile of anoyntyng, a calf for synne, twei rammes, a panyere with therf looues;
and thou schalt gedere al the cumpanye to the dore of the tabernacle.
Moises dide as the Lord comaundide; and whanne al the company was gaderid bifor the yatis of the tabernacle, he seide,
This is the word which the Lord comaundid to be don.
And anoon Moises offride Aaron and hise sones; and whanne he hadde waischun hem,
he clothide the bischop with a lynnun schirte, `and girdide `the bischop with a girdil, and clothide with a coote of iacynt, and `puttide the cloth on the schuldris aboue,
which cloth on the schuldris he boond with a girdil, and `dresside to the racional, wherynne doctryn and truthe was.
And Moises hilide the heed with a mytre, and `settide theronne, ayens the forhed, the goldun plate halewid in halewyng, as the Lord comaundide to hym.
He took also the oile of anoyntyng, with which he anoyntide the tabernacle with al his purtenaunce;
and whanne he hadde halewid and hadde spreynt the auter seuen sithes, he anoyntide it, and halewide with oile alle the vessels therof, and the `greet waischyng vessel with his foundement.
Which oile he schedde on `the heed of Aaron, and anoyntide hym, and halewide.
And he clothide with lynnun cootis, and girdide with girdils `his sones offrid, and settide on mytris, as the Lord comaundide.
He offeride also a calf for synne; and whanne Aaron and hise sones hadden put her hondis on `that calf,
he offride it, and drow up blood; and whanne the fyngur was dippid, he touchide the corneris of the auter bi cumpas; whanne the auter was clensid and halewid, he schedde the `residue blood at the `foundement therof.
Sotheli he brent on the auter the ynnere fatnesse that was on the entrails, and the calle of the mawe, and the twei litle reynes with her litle fatnessis;
and he brente without the castels the calf, with the skyn, fleischis, and dung, as the Lord comaundide.
He offride also a ram in to brent sacrifice; and whanne Aaron and hise sones hadden set her hondis on the heed therof,
he offride it, and schedde the blood therof bi the cumpas of the auter.
And he kittide thilke ram in to gobetis, and brente with fier the heed therof, and membris,
and ynnere fatnesse, whanne the entrails and feet weren waischun bifore; and he brente al the ram togidere on the auter, for it was the brent sacrifice of swettiste odour to the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym.
He offride also the secounde ram, in to the halewyng of preestis; and Aaron and hise sones puttiden her hondis on the heed therof.
And whanne Moises hadde offrid the ram, he took of the blood, and touchide the laste part of the riyt eere of Aaron, and the thombe of his riyt hond, in lijk maner and of the foot.
He offride also `the sones of Aaron. And whanne he hadde touchid of the blood of the ram offrid the laste part of `the riyt eeris of alle, and `the thombis of the riyt hond and foot, he schedde the `tothir blood on the auter bi cumpas.
Sotheli he departide the ynnere fatnesse, and the taile, and al the fatnesse that hilith the entrails, and the calle of the mawe, and the twey reynes with her fatnessis and with the riyt schuldur.
Forsothe he took of the panyere of therf looues, that was bifor the Lord, looues without sour dow, and a cake spreynt with oile, and he puttide looues first sodun in watir and aftirward fried in oile on the ynnere fatnesse, and the riyt schuldur; and bitook alle thingis togidere to Aaron,
and to hise sones. And aftir that thei `reisiden tho bifore the Lord,
eft `he brente tho takun of her hondis, on the auter of brent sacrifice, for it was the offryng of halewyng, in to the odour of swetnesse of sacrifice `into his part to the Lord.
He took also the brest of the ram of consecracioun in to his part, and reiside it bifor the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym.
And he took the oynement, and blood that was in the auter, and `spreynte on Aaron, and hise clothis, and on `the sones of hym, and on her clothis.
And whanne he hadde halewid hem in her clothing, he comaundide to hem, and seide, Sethe ye fleischis bifor the `yatis of the tabernacle, and there ete ye tho; also ete ye the looues of halewyng, that ben put in the panyere, as God comaundide to me, `and seide, Aaron and hise sones schulen ete tho looues;
sotheli whateuer thing is residue of the fleisch and looues, fier schal waste.
Also ye schulen not go out of the dore of the tabernacle in seuene daies, til to the day in which the tyme of youre halewyng schal be fillid; for the halewyng is endid in seuene dayes,
as it is doon in present tyme, that the riytfulnesse of sacrifice were fillid.
Ye schulen dwelle dai and nyyt in the tabernacle, and ye schulen kepe the kepyngis of the Lord, that ye die not; for so it is comaundid to me.
And Aaron and hise sones diden alle thingis, whiche the Lord spak bi the hond of Moises.
Forsothe whanne the eiytithe dai was maad, Moises clepide Aaron, and hise sones, and the grettere men in birthe of Israel;
and he seide to Aaron, Take thou of the droue a calf for synne, and a ram `in to brent sacrifice, euer either with oute wem, and offre tho bifor the Lord.
And thou schalt speke to the sones of Israel, Take ye a buk of geet for synne, and a calf, and a lomb of o yeer and with out wem,
in to brent sacrifice, an oxe and a ram for pesible thingis; and offre ye tho bifor the Lord, and offre ye whete flour spreynt with oile in the sacrifice of ech; for to dai the Lord schal appere to you.
Therfor thei token alle thingis, whiche Moises comaundide, to the dore of the tabernacle, where, whanne al the multitude stood,
Moises seide, This is the word, which the Lord comaundide, do ye, and his glorie schal appere to you.
And Moises seide to Aaron, Neiye thou to the auter, and offre thou for thi synne; offre thou brent sacrifice, and preye for thee, and for the puple; and whanne thou hast slayn the sacrifice of the puple, preye thou for hem, as the Lord comaundide.
And anoon Aaron neiyede to the auter, and offride a calf for his synne;
whos blood hise sones offriden to him, in which blood he dippide the fyngur, and touchide the hornes of the auter, and schedde the residue at the foundement therof;
and he brente on the auter the ynnere fatnesse, and litle reynes, and the calle of the mawe, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
Forsothe he brente bi fier without the castels the fleischis and skyn therof.
And he offride the beeste of brent sacrifice, and hise sones offriden to hym the blood therof, which he schedde bi the cumpas of the auter;
thei offriden also thilke sacrifice kit in to gobetis, with the heed, and alle membris; and he brente bi fier alle these thingis on the auter,
whanne the entrailis and feet weren waischun bifor with watir.
And he offride and killide a buk of geet, for the synne of the puple; and whanne the auter was clensid,
he made brent sacrifice,
and addide in to the sacrifice fletynge offryngis that ben offrid togidere; and he brente tho on the auter, without cerymonyes of brent sacrifice of the morewtid.
He offride also an oxe, and a ram, pesible sacrifices of the puple; and hise sones offriden to hym the blood, which he schedde bi the cumpas of the auter.
Forsothe thei puttiden on the brestis the ynnere fatnesse of the oxe, and the tail of the ram, and the litle reynes with her fatnessis, and the calle of the mawe.
And whanne the ynnere fatnessis weren brent in the auter,
Aaron departide the brestis, and the riyt schuldris of tho, and reiside bifor the Lord, as Moises comaundide.
And he streiyte forth hondis to the puple, and blesside it; and so whanne the sacrifices for synne, and brent sacrifices, and pesible sacrifices, weren fillid, he cam doun.
Sotheli Moyses and Aaron entriden in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, and yeden out aftirward, and blessiden the puple; and the glorie of the Lord apperide to al the multitude.
And lo! fier yede out fro the Lord, and deuouride the brent sacrifice, and the ynnere fatnesses that weren on the auter; and whanne the cumpanyes hadden seyn this thing, thei preiseden the Lord, `and felden on her faces.
And whanne Nadab and Abyu, the sones of Aaron, hadden take censeris, thei puttiden fier and encense aboue, and offriden bifor the Lord alien fier, which thing was not comaundid to hem.
And fier yede out fro the Lord, and deuouride hem, and thei weren deed bifor the Lord.
And Moises seide to Aaron, This thing it is which the Lord spak, Y schal be halewid in hem that neiyen to me, and Y schal be glorified in the siyt of al the puple; which thing Aaron herde, and was stille.
Sotheli whanne Moises hadde clepid Mysael and Elisaphan, the sones of Oziel, brother of Aaron's fadir, he seide to hem, Go ye, and take awey youre britheren fro the siyt of seyntuarie, and bere ye out of the castels.
And anoon thei yeden, and token hem, as thei laien clothid with lynnun cootis, and castiden out, as it was comaundid to hem.
And Moises spak to Aaron, and to Eliasar and Ithamar, the sones of Aaron, Nyle ye make nakid youre heedis, and nyle ye reende clothis, lest perauenture ye dien, and indignacioun rise on al the cumpany; youre britheren and all the hows of Israel byweile the brennyng which the Lord reiside.
But ye schulen not go out of the yatis of the tabernacle, ellis ye schulen perische; for the oile of hooli anoyntyng is on you. Whiche diden alle thingis bi the comaundement of Moises.
Also the Lord seide to Aaron,
Thou and thi sones schulen not drynke wyn, and al thing that may make drunkun, whanne ye schulen entre in to the tabernacle of witnessing, lest ye dien; for it is euerlastynge comaundement in to youre generaciouns,
that ye haue kunnyng to make doom bytwixe hooli thing and vnhooli, bitwixe pollutid thing and cleene;
and that ye teche the sones of Israel alle my lawful thingis, whiche the Lord spak to hem bi the hond of Moyses.
And Moises spak to Aaron, and to Eliazar and Ythamar, hise sones, that weren residue, Take ye the sacrifice that lefte of the offryng of the Lord, and ete ye it with out sour dow, bisidis the auter, for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
Sotheli ye schulen ete in the hooli place that that is youun to thee and to thi sones, of the offryngis of the Lord, as it is comaundid to me Also thou,
and thi sones, and thi douytris with thee, schulen ete in the clenneste place the brest which is offrid, and the schuldur which is departid; for tho ben kept to thee and to thi fre sones, of the heelful sacrifices of the sones of Israel;
for thei reiseden bifor the Lord the schuldur and brest, and the ynnere fatnessis that ben brent in the auter; and perteynen tho to thee, and to thi sones, bi euerlastynge lawe, as the Lord comaundide.
Among these thingis whanne Moises souyte the `buk of geet that was offrid for synne, he foond it brent, and he was wrooth ayens Eliazar and Ythamar, `the sones of Aaron that weren left.
And he seide, Whi eten not ye the sacrifice for synne in the hooli place, which sacrifice is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis, and is youun to you, that ye bere the wickydnesse of the multitude, and preye for it in the siyt of the Lord;
moost sithen of the blood therof is not borun yn with ynne hooli thingis, and ye ouyten ete it in the seyntuarie, as it is comaundid to me?
And Aaron answeride, Sacrifice for synne, and brent sacrifice is offrid to dai bifor the Lord; sotheli this that thou seest, bifelde to me; how myyte Y ete it, ether plese God in cerymonyes with soreuful soule?
And whanne Moises hadde herd this, he resseyuede satisfaccioun.
And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, and seide,
Seie ye to the sones of Israel, Kepe ye alle thingis whiche Y wroot to you, that Y be youre God. These ben the beestis, whiche ye schulen ete, of alle lyuynge beestis of erthe;
ye schulen ete `al thing among beestis that hath a clee departid, and chewith code;
sotheli what euer thing chewith code, and hath a clee, but departith not it, as a camel and othere beestis doon, ye schulen not ete it, and ye schulen arette among vnclene thingis.
A cirogrille, which chewith code, and departith not the clee, is vnclene; and an hare,
for also he chewith code, but departith not the clee;
and a swiyn, that chewith not code, thouy he departith the clee.
Ye schulen not ete the fleischis of these, nether ye schulen touche the deed bodies, for tho ben vnclene to you.
Also these thingis ben that ben gendrid in watris, and is leueful to ete;
ye schulen ete al thing that hath fynnes and scalis, as wel in the see, as in floodis and stondynge watris; sotheli what euer thing of tho that ben moued and lyuen in watris, hath not fynnes and scalis, schal be abhominable, and wlatsum to you;
ye schulen not ete the fleischis of tho, and ye schulen eschewe the bodies deed bi hem silf.
Alle thingis in watris that han not fynnes and scalis, schulen be pollutid,
These thingis ben of foulis whiche ye schulen not ete, and schulen be eschewid of you; an egle, and a grippe, aliete, and a kyte, and a vultur by his kynde;
and al of `rauyns kynde bi his licnesse;
a strucioun,
and nyyt crowe, a lare, and an hauke bi his kinde;
an owle, and dippere, and ibis ;
a swan and cormoraunt, and a pellican;
a fawcun, a iay bi his kynde; a leepwynke, and a reremows.
Al thing of foulis that goith on foure feet, schal be abhomynable to you;
sotheli what euer thing goith on foure feet, but hath lengere hipis bihynde, bi whiche it skippith on the erthe, ye schulen ete;
as is a bruke in his kynde, and acatus, and opymacus, and a locuste, alle bi her kynde.
Forsothe what euer thing of briddis hath foure feet oneli, it schal be abhomynable to you;
and who euer touchith her bodies deed bi hem silf, schal be defoulid, and `schal be vnclene `til to euentid;
and if it is nede, that he bere ony deed thing of these, he schal waische his clothis, and he schal be vnclene til to the goyng doun of the sunne.
Sotheli ech beeste that hath a clee, but departith not it, nether chewith code, schal be vnclene; and what euer thing touchith it, schal be defoulid.
That that goith on hondis, of alle beestis that gon on foure feet, schal be vnclene; he, that touchith her bodies deed bi hem silf, schal be defoulid `til to euentid;
and he, that berith siche deed bodies, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be vnclene `til to euentid; for alle these thingis ben vnclene to you.
Also these thingis schulen be arettid among defoulid thingis, of these that ben moued on erthe; a wesele, and mows, and a cocodrille, `alle bi her kynde;
mygal, camelion, and stellio, and lacerta, and a maldewerp.
Alle these ben vnclene; he that touchith her bodies deed bi hem silf, schal be vnclene `til to euentid;
and that thing schal be defoulid, on which ony thing of her bodies deed bi hem silf fallith, as wel a vessel of tree, and a cloth, as skynnes `and heiris; and in what euer thing werk is maad, it schal be dippid in watir, and tho thingis schulen be defoulid `til to euentid, and so aftirward tho schulen be clensid.
Sotheli a vessel of erthe, in which ony thing of these fallith with ynne, schal be defoulid, and therfor it schal be brokun.
Ech mete, which ye schulen ete, schal be vnclene, if water is sched thereon; and ech fletynge thing, which is drunkun of ech vessel, `where ynne vnclene thingis bifelden, schal be vnclene;
and what euer thing of siche deed bodies bi hem silf felde theronne, it schal be vnclene, whether furneisis, ethir vessels of thre feet, tho schulen be destried, and schulen be vnclene.
Sotheli wellis and cisternes, and al the congregacioun of watris, schal be clene. He that touchith her bodi deed bi it silf, schal be defoulid.
If it fallith on seed, it schal not defoule the seed;
sotheli if ony man schedith seed with watir, and aftirward the watir is touchid with deed bodies bi hem silf, it schal be defoulid anoon.
If a beeste is deed, which it is leueful to you to ete, he that touchith the deed bodi therof schal be vnclene `til to euentid; and he that etith therof ony thing,
ethir berith, schal waische his clothis, and schal be vnclene `til to euentid.
Al thing that crepith on erthe, schal be abhomynable, nether schal be takun in to mete.
`What euer thing goith on the brest and foure feet, and hath many feet, ethir drawun bi the erthe, ye schulen not ete, for it is abhomynable.
Nyle ye defoule youre soulis, nether touche ye ony thing of tho, lest ye ben vnclene;
for Y am youre Lord God; be ye hooli, for Y am hooli. Defoule ye not youre soulis in ech crepynge `beeste which is moued on erthe; for Y am the Lord,
that ladde you out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde be to you in to God; ye schulen be hooli, for Y am hooli.
This is the lawe of lyuynge beestes, and of foulis, and of ech lyuynge soule which is moued in watir, and crepith in erthe;
that ye knowe differences of clene thing and vnclene, and that ye wite what ye schulen ete, and what ye owen forsake.
And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seie to hem, If a womman, whanne sche hath resseyued seed, childith a knaue child, sche schal be vnclene bi seuene daies bi the daies of departyng of corrupt blood, that renneth bi monethis;
and the yong child schal be circumsidid in the eiytithe dai.
Sotheli sche schal dwelle thre and thretti daies in the blood of hir purifiyng; sche schal not touche ony hooli thing, nethir sche schal entre in to the seyntuarie, til the daies of her clensing be fillid.
Sotheli if sche childith a female, sche schal be vnclene twei woukis, bi the custom of flowyng of vnclene blood, and `thre scoor and sixe daies sche schal dwelle in the blood of her clensyng.
And whanne the daies of hir clensyng, for a sone, ether for a douytir, ben fillid, sche schal brynge a lomb of o yeer in to brent sacrifice, and a `bryd of a culuer, ethir a turtle, for synne, to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and sche schal yyue to the preest, which schal offre tho bifor the Lord, and schal preye for hir, and so sche schal be clensid fro the fowyng of hir blood. This is the lawe of a womman childynge a male, ethir a female.
That if hir hond fyndith not, nethir may offre a lomb, sche schal take twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueres, oon in to brent sacrifice, and the tother for synne; and the preest schal preye for hir, and so sche schal be clensid.
The Lord spak to Moyses and Aaron, and seide,
A man in whos skyn and fleisch rysith dyuerse colour, ether whelke, ethir as `sum schynynge thing, that is, a wounde of lepre, he schal be brouyt to Aaron preest, ether to oon `who euer of hise sones;
and whanne he seeth lepre in the skyn, and the heeris chaungide in to whijte colour, and that spice of lepre lowere than the tother skyn and fleisch, it is a wounde of lepre, and he schal be departid at the `doom of the preest.
Sotheli if schynyng whijtnesse is in the skyn, nethir is lower than the tother fleisch, and the heeris ben of the formere colour, the preest schal close hym seuene daies;
and schal biholde hym in the seuenthe dai, and sotheli if the lepre wexith not ferther, nethir passith the formere termes in the fleisch, eft the preest schal close hym ayen seuene other daies;
and schal biholde in the seuenthe day, if the lepre is derkere, and wexith not in the fleisch, the preest schal clense hym, for it is a scabbe; and the man schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be clene.
That if the lepre wexith eft, aftir that he is seyn of the preest, and is yoldun to clennesse, he schal be brouyt to the preest, and schal be demed of vnclennesse.
If the wounde of lepre is in man, he schal be brouyt to the preest, and he schal se the man;
and whanne whijt colour is in the fleisch, and chaungith the siyt of heeris, and thilke fleisch apperith quyk,
it schal be demid eldest lepre, and growun to the skyn; therfor the preest schal defoule hym,
and he schal not close eft, for it is of opyn vnclennesse.
But if lepre rennynge about in the skyn `flourith out, and hilith al the fleisch, fro the heed til to the feet, what euer thing fallith vndur the siyt of iyen; the preest schal biholde hym,
and schal deme `that he is holdun with clenneste lepre, for all the skyn is turned in to whijtnesse, and therfor the man schal be cleene.
Sotheli whanne quyk fleisch apperith in hym,
thanne he schal be defoulid bi the doom of the preest, and he schal be arettid among vncleene men; for quyk fleisch is vnclene, if it is spreynt with lepre.
That if the fleisch is turned eft in to whijtnesse, and hilith al the man,
the preest schal biholde hym, and schal deme, that he is cleene.
Fleisch and skyn, in which a botche is bred,
and is heelid, and `a step of wounde apperith whijt, ethir `sum deel reed, `in the place of the botche, the man schal be brouyt to the preest;
and whanne the preest seeth the place of lepre lowere than the tother fleisch, and the heeris turned in to whijtnesse, the preest schal defoule hym ; for the wounde of lepre is bred in the botche.
That if the heer is of the former colour, and the signe of wounde is sumdeel derk, and is not lowere than the `nyy fleisch, the preest schal close the man seuene daies;
and sotheli, if it wexith, the preest schal deme the man of lepre;
forsothe if it stondith in his place, it is a signe of botche, and the man schal be cleene.
Fleisch and skyn, which the fier hath brent, and is heelid, and hath a whijt ethir reed `signe of wounde,
the preest schal biholde it, and lo! if it is turned in to whijtnesse, and the place therof is lowere than the tothir skyn, the preest schal defoule the man, for a wounde of lepre is bred in the `signe of wounde.
That if the colour of heeris is not chaungid, nether the wounde is lowere than the tother fleisch, and thilke spice of lepre is sumdeel derk, the preest schal close the man bi seuene daies;
and in the seuenthe dai he schal biholde; if the lepre wexith in the fleisch, the preest schal defoule the man;
ellis if the whijtnesse stondith in his place, and is not cleer ynow, it is a wounde of brennyng, and therfor the man schal be clensid, for it is a signe of brennyng.
A man ethir womman, in whos heed ether beerd lepre buriounneth, the preest schal se hem;
and if the place is lowere than the tothir fleisch, and the heer is whijt, `and is sotilere, `ether smallere, than it is wont, the preest schal defoule hem, for it is lepre of the heed, and of the beerd.
Ellis if he seeth the place of wem euene with the nyy fleisch, and seeth the here blak, the preest schal close hem bi seuene daies, and schal se in the seuenthe dai;
if the wem waxith not, and the heer is of his colour, and the place of wounde is euene with the tother fleisch,
the man schal be schauun, without the place of wem, and he schal be closid eft bi seuene othere daies.
If in the seuenthe day the wounde is seyn to haue stonde in his place, nether is lowere than the tother fleisch, the preest schal clense the man; and whanne his clothis ben waischun, he schal be cleene.
Ellis if aftir the clensyng a spotte wexith eft in the skyn,
the preest schal no more enquere, whether the heer is chaungid in to whijt colour, for apeertli he is vncleene.
Sotheli if the spotte stondith, and the heeris ben blake, knowe the preest that the man is heelid, and tristili `pronounce he the man cleene.
A man ethir a womman, in whos skyn whijtnesse apperith, the preest schal biholde hem;
if he perseyueth, that whijtnesse `sum deel derk schyneth in the skyn, wite he, that it is no lepre, but a spotte of whijt colour, and that the man is cleene.
A man of whos heed heeris fleten awei, is calu, and clene;
and if heeris fallen fro the forheed, he is ballid,
and is cleene; ellis if in the ballidnesse bifore, ether in the ballidnesse bihynde, whijt ether reed colour is bred, and the preest seeth this,
he schal condempne the man without doute of lepre, which is bred in the ballidnesse.
Therfor whoeuer is defoulid with lepre, and is departid at the doom of the preest,
he schal haue hise clothis vnsewid, bareheed, the mouth hilid with a cloth, he schal crye hym silf defoulid, and viyl;
in al tyme in which he is lepre and vnclene, he schal dwelle aloone without the castels.
A wollun cloth, ethir lynnun, that hath lepre in the warp,
ethir oof, ethir certis a skyn, ether what euer thing is maad of skiyn,
if it is corrupt with a whijt spotte, ethir reed, it schal be arettid lepre, and it schal be schewid to the preest;
which schal close it biholden bi seuene daies.
And eft he schal biholde in the seuenthe dai, and if he perseyueth, that it wexide, it schal be contynuel lepre; he schal deme the cloth defoulid, and al thing in which it is foundun;
and therfor the cloth schal be brent in flawmes.
That if he seeth that the spotte wexide not, he schal comaunde,
and thei schulen waische that thing wherynne the lepre is, and he schal close it ayen bi seuene othere daies;
and whanne he seeth the formere face not turned ayen, netheles that nether the lepre wexede, he schal deme that thing vnclene, and he schal brenne it in fier, for lepre is sched in the ouer part of the cloth, ether thorouy al.
Ellis if the `place of lepre is derkere, aftir that the cloth is waischun, he schal breke awey that place, and schal departe fro the hool.
That if fleynge lepre and vnstidefast apperith ferthermore in these places, that weren vnwemmed bifore, it owith be brent in fier; if it ceessith,
he schal waische the secounde tyme tho thingis that ben cleene, and tho schulen be cleene.
This is the lawe of lepre of cloth, wollun and lynnun, of warp and of oof, and of al purtenaunce of skiyn, hou it owith to be clensyd, ethir `to be defoulid.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, This is the custom of a leprouse man,
whanne he schal be clensid. He schal be brouyt to the preest,
which preest schal go out of the castels, and whanne he schal fynde that the lepre is clensid,
he schal comaunde to the man which is clensid, that he offre for hym silf twei quyke sparewis, whiche it is leueful to ete, and a `tree of cedre, and vermylyoun, and isope.
And the preest schal comaunde that oon of the sparewes be offrid in `a vessel of erthe,
on quyke watris; sotheli he schal dippe the tother sparewe quyk with the `tre of cedre, and with a reed threed and ysope, in the blood of the sparewe offrid,
with which he schal sprenge seuensithis hym that schal be clensid, that he be purgid riytfuli; and he schal delyuere the quyk sparewe, that it fle in to the feeld.
And whanne the man hath waische hise clothis, he schal schaue alle the heeris of the bodi, and he schal be waischun in watir, and he schal be clensid, and he schal entre in to the castels; so oneli that he dwelle without his tabernacle bi seuene daies;
and that in the seuenthe dai he schaue the heeris of the heed, and the beerd, and brewis, and the heeris of al the bodi. And whanne the clothis and bodi ben waischun,
eft in the eiyetithe dai he schal take twei lambren without wem, and a scheep of o yeer without wem, and thre dymes of wheete flour, in to sacrifice, which be spreynte with oile, and bi it silf a sextarie of oyle.
And whanne the preest, that purgith the man, hath set hym and alle hise thingis bifor the Lord, in the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, he schal take a lomb,
and schal offre it for trespas, and schal offre the sextarie of oyle; and whanne alle thingis ben offrid bifor the Lord,
he schal offre the lomb, where the sacrifice for synne and the brent sacrifice is wont to be offrid, that is, in the hooli place; for as for synne so and for trespas the offryng perteyneth to the preest; it is hooli of the noumbre of hooli thingis.
And the preest schal take of the blood of sacrifice which is offrid for trespas, and schal putte on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym which is clensid, and on the thumbis of the riyt hond and foot.
And he schal putte of the sextarie of oyle in to his left hond,
and he schal dippe the riyt fyngur therynne, and schal sprynge seuensithis bifor the Lord.
Sotheli he schal schede that that is residue of the oile in the left hond, on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym which is clensid, and on the thombis of the riyt hond and foot, and on the blood which is sched for trespas,
and on the heed `of hym.
And the preest schal preye for hym bifor the Lord, and schal make sacrifice for synne; thanne he schal offre brent sacrifice,
and schal putte it in the auter with hise fletynge sacrifices, and the man schal be clensid riytfuli.
That if he is pore, and his hoond may not fynde tho thingis that ben seid, he schal take for trespas a lomb to offryng, that the preest preie for him, and the tenthe part of wheete flour spreynt togidire with oile in to sacrifice, and a sextarie of oile,
and twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, of whiche oon be for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice;
and he schal offre tho in the eiytthe dai of his clensyng to the preest, at the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng bifor the Lord.
And the preest schal take the lomb for trespas, and the sextarie of oile, and schal reise togidere;
and whanne the lomb is offrid, he schal putte of the blood therof on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym that is clensid, and on the thumbis of his riyt hond and foot.
Sotheli the preest putte the part of oile in to his left hond,
in which he schal dippe the fyngur of the riyt hond, and schal sprynge seuensithes ayens the Lord;
and the preest schal touche the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym that is clensid, and the thombe of the riyt hond and foot, in the place of blood which is sched out for trespas.
Sotheli he schal putte the tother part of oile, which is in the left hond, on the `heed of the man clensid, that he plese the Lord for hym.
And he schal offre a turtle, ethir a culuer brid,
oon for trespas, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice, with her fletynge offryngis.
This is the sacrifice of a leprouse man, that may not haue alle thingis in to the clensyng of hym silf.
And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, and seide,
Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of Canaan, which lond Y schal yyue to you in to possessioun, if the wounde of lepre is in the housis,
he schal go, whos the hous is, `and schal telle to the preest, and schal seie, It semeth to me, that as a wound of lepre is in myn hous.
And the preest schal comaunde, `that thei bere out of the hous alle thingis bifore that he entre in to it, `and me se where it be lepre, lest alle thingis that ben in the hows, be maad vnclene; and the preest schal entre aftirward, that he se the lepre of the hows.
And whanne he seeth in the wallis therof as litle valeis `foule bi palenesse, ethir bi reednesse, and lowere than the tother hiyere part,
he schal go out at the dore of the hows, and anoon he schal close it bi seuene daies.
And he schal turne ayen in the seuenthe day, and schal se it; if he fyndith that the lepre encreesside,
he schal comaunde that the stoonys be cast out, in whyche the lepre is, and that tho stonys be cast out of the citee in an vncleene place.
Sotheli he schal comaunde that thilke hows be rasid with ynne bi cumpas, and that the dust of the rasyng be spreynt without the citee, in an vnclene place,
and that othere stoonys be put ayen for these, that ben takun awey, and that the hows be daubid with othir morter.
But if aftir that the stoonus ben takun awey, and the dust is borun out,
and othere erthe is daubid, the preest entrith, and seeth the lepre turned ayen, and the wallis spreynt with spottis, the lepre is stidfastly dwellynge, and the hows is vnclene;
which hows thei schulen destrye anoon, and thei schulen caste out of the citee, in an vnclene place, the stoonys therof, and the trees, and al the dust.
He that entrith in to the hous, whanne it is schit, schal be vnclene `til to euentid,
and he that slepith and etith ony thing therynne, schal waische hise clothis.
That if the preest entrith, and seeth that the lepre encreesside not in the hows, aftir that it was daubid the secounde tyme, he schal clense it; for heelthe is yoldun.
And in the clensyng therof he schal take twey sparewis, and `a tre of cedre, and `a reed threed, and isope.
And whanne o sparewe is offrid in a vessel of erthe, on quyk watris,
he schal take the `tre of cedre, and ysope, and reed threed, and the quyk sparewe, and he schal dippe alle thingis in the blood of the sparewe offrid, and in lyuynge watris;
and he schal sprynge the hows seuen sithis; and he schal clense it as wel in the blood of the sparewe as in lyuynge watris, and in the quyk sparewe, and in the `tre of cedre, and in ysope, and `reed threed.
And whanne he hath left the sparewe to fle in to the feeld frely, he schal preye for the hows, and it schal be clensid riytfuli.
This is the lawe of al lepre,
and of smytyng, of lepre of clothis, and of housis,
of syngne of wounde, and of litle whelkis brekynge out, of spotte schynynge, and in colours chaungid in to dyuerse spices,
that it may be wist, what is cleene, ether uncleene.
And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, `and seide,
Speke ye to the sones of Israel, and seie ye to hem, A man that suffrith the rennyng out of seed, schal be vncleene;
and thanne he schal be demed to be suget to this vice, whanne bi alle momentis foul vmour `ethir moysture cleueth to his fleisch, and growith togidere.
Ech bed in which he slepith schal be vncleene, and where euer he sittith.
If ony man touchith his bed, he schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
If a man sittith where he satt, also thilke man schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vnclene `til to euentid.
He that touchith hise fleischis, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
If sich a man castith out spetyng on hym that is cleene, he schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
The sadil on which he sittith,
schal be vncleene; and ech man that touchith what euer thing is vndur hym that suffrith the fletyng out of seed, schal be defoulid `til to euentid. He that berith ony of these thingis, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
Ech man, whom he that is such touchith with hondis not waischun bifore, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
`A vessel of erthe which he touchith, schal be brokun; but a `vessel of tre schal be waischun in watir.
If he that suffrith sich a passioun, is heelid, he schal noumbre seuene daies aftir his clensyng, and whanne the clothis and al `the bodi ben waischun in lyuynge watris, he schal be clene.
Forsothe in the eiytthe dai he schal take twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of a culuer, and he schal come in the `siyt of the Lord at the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng, and schal yyue tho to the preest;
and the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preye for hym bifor the Lord, that he be clensid fro the fletyng out of his seed.
A man fro whom the seed of letcherie, `ethir of fleischli couplyng, goith out, schal waische in watir al his bodi, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
He schal waische in watir the cloth `and skyn which he hath, and it schal be unclene `til to euentid.
The womman with which he `is couplid fleischli, schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
A womman that suffrith the fletyng out of blood, whanne the moneth cometh ayen, schal be departid bi seuene daies; ech man that touchith hir schal be vncleene `til to euentid,
and the place in which sche slepith ether sittith in the daies of hir departyng, schal be defoulid.
He that touchith her bed, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
Who euer touchith ony vessel on which sche sittith, he schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be defoulid `til to euentid.
<range>
If a man is couplid fleischli with hir in the tyme of blood that renneth bi monethis, he schal be vncleene bi seuene daies, and ech bed in which he slepith schal be defoulid.
A womman that suffrith in many daies the `fletyng out of blood, not in the tyme of monethis, ethir which womman ceessith not to flete out blood aftir the blood of monethis, schal be vncleene as longe as sche `schal be suget to this passioun, as if sche is in the tyme of monethis.
Ech bed in which sche slepith, and `vessel in which sche sittith, schal be defoulid.
Who euer touchith hir schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
If the blood stondith, and ceessith to flete out, sche schal noumbre seuene daies of hir clensyng,
and in the eiytthe dai sche schal offre for hir silf to the preest twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preye for hir bifor the Lord, and for the fletyng out of hir vnclennesse.
Therfor ye schulen teche the sones of Israel, that thei eschewe vnclennessis, and that thei die not for her filthis, whanne thei defoulen my tabernacle which is among hem.
This is the lawe of hym that suffrith fletyng out of seed, and which is defoulid with fleischly couplyng,
and of a womman which is departid in the tymes of monethis, ethir which flowith out in contynuel blood, and of the man that slepith with hir.
And the Lord spak to Moises, aftir the deeth of the twei sones of Aaron, whanne thei offriden alien fier, and weren slayn, and comaundide to hym,
and seide, Speke thou to Aaron, thi brother, that he entre not in al tyme in to the seyntuarie, which is with ynne the veil bifor the propiciatorie, bi which the arke is hilid, that he die not; for Y schal appere in a cloude on Goddis answeryng place;
`no but he do these thingis bifore. He schal offer a calf for synne, and a ram in to brent sacrifice;
he schal be clothid with a lynnun coote, he schal hide the schamefast membris with pryuy lynnun clothis; he schal be gird with a lynnun girdil, he schal putte a lynnun mytre on his heed; for these clothis ben hooli, with whiche alle he schal be clothid, whanne he is waischun.
And he schal take of al the multitude of the sones of Israel twei kidis for synne, and o ram in to brent sacrifice;
and whanne he offrith a calf, and preieth for hym,
and for his hows, he schal make twei `buckis of geet to stonde bifor the Lord, in the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and he schal sende `on euer eithir, o lot to the Lord, and another lot to the goot that schal be sent out.
Whos lot goith out to the Lord, he schal offre it for synne;
sotheli whos lot goith out in to goot that schal be sent out, he schal sette hym quyk bifor the Lord, that he sende preyers `on hym, and sende hym out in to wildirnesse.
Whanne these thingis ben doon riytfuli, he schal offre the calf, and `he schal preye for hym silf, and for his hows, and schal offre the calf.
And whanne he hath take the censeer, which he hath fillid of the coolis of the auter, and `he hath take in hond the `swete smellynge spicery maad into encense, he schal entre ouer the veil in to the hooli thingis;
that whanne swete smellynge spiceries ben put on the fier, the cloude and `vapour of tho hile Goddis answeryng place, which is on the witnessyng, and he die not.
Also he schal take of the `blood of the calf, and he schal sprenge seuensithis with the fyngur ayens `the propiciatorie, `to the eest.
And whanne he hath slayn the `buk of geet, for synne of the puple, he schal brynge in the blood therof with ynne the veil, as it is comaundid of the `blood of the calf, that he sprynge euene ayens Goddis answeryng place,
and he schal clense the seyntuarie fro vnclennessis of the sones of Israel, and fro her trespassyngis, and alle synnes. Bi this custom he schal do in the tabernacle of witnessyng, which is set among hem, in the myddis of partis of the abitacioun `of hem.
No man be in the tabernacle, whanne the bischop schal entre in to the seyntuarie, that he preye for hym silf, and for his hows, and for al the cumpeny of Israel, til he go out of the tabernacle.
Sotheli whanne he hath go out to the auter which is bifor the Lord, preye he for hym silf, and schede he on the hornes therof, bi cumpas, the blood `that is takun of the calf, and of the `buk of geet;
and sprynge he seuensithis with the fyngur, and clense he, and halewe the autir fro vnclennessis of the sones of Israel.
Aftir that he hath clensid the seyntuarie, and tabernacle, and auter, thanne offre he the lyuynge `buc of geet;
and whanne euer eithir hond is set on the heed therof, knowleche the preest alle the wickidnessis of the sones of Israel, and alle the trespassis and synnes `of hem, whiche the preest schal wische to the heed therof, and schal sende hym out in to deseert bi a man maad redi.
And whanne the `buc of geet hath bore alle the wickidnessis `of hem in to a deseert lond,
and is left `in deseert, Aaron schal turn ayen in to the tabernacle of witnessyng; and whanne the clothis ben put of, in whiche he was clothid bifore, whanne he entrid in to the seyntuarie of God, and ben left there,
he schal waische his fleisch in the hooli place, and he schal be clothid in his owen clothis, and aftir that he hath go out, and hath offrid the brent sacrifice of hym silf, and of the puple, he schal preye as wel for hym silf, as for the puple;
and he schal brenne on the auter the innere fatnesse which is offrid for synne.
Sotheli he that leet go the `buk of geet able to be sent out, schal waische hise clothis and bodi with water, and so he schal entre in to the castels.
Forsothe thei schulen bere out of the castels the calf and `buk of geet, that weren offrid for synne, and whos blood was brouyt in to the seyntuarie, that the clensyng were fillid; and thei schulen brenne bi fier as well the skynnys, as the fleischis and dung of tho.
And who euer brenneth tho, schal waische hise clothis and fleisch in watir, and so he schal entre in to the castels.
And this schal be to you a lawful thing euerlastynge; in the seuenthe monethe, in the tenthe dai of the monethe, ye schulen turment youre soulis, and ye schulen not do ony werk, nethir a man borun in the lond, nether a comelyng which is a pilgrym among you.
The delyueryng fro synne, and the clensyng of you schal be in this dai, ye schulen be clensid bifore the Lord fro alle youre synnes;
for it is sabat of restyng, and ye schulen turment youre soulis bi euerlastynge religioun.
Sotheli the preest schal clense, which is anoyntid, and whos hondis ben halewid, that he be set in preesthod for his fadir; and he schal be clothid in a lynnun stoole, and in hooli clothis,
and he schal clense the seyntuarie, and the tabernacle of witnessyng, and the auter, and the preestis, and al the puple.
And this schal be to you a lawful thing euerlastynge, that ye preye for the sones of Israel, and for alle the synnes `of hem, onys in the yeer. Therfor he dide, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to Aaron,
and to hise sones, and to alle the sones of Israel, and seie thou to hem, This is the word which the Lord comaundide,
and seide, Ech man of the hows of Israel schal be gilti of blood, if he sleeth an oxe, ether a scheep, ethir a geet in the castels, ethir out of the castels,
and offrith not an offryng to the Lord at the dore of the tabernacle; as he schedde mannus blood, so he schal perische fro the myddis of his puple.
Therfor the sones of Israel owen to offre her sacrifices to the preest, whiche thei sleen in the feeld, that tho be halewid to the Lord, bifor the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, and that thei offre tho pesible sacrifices to the Lord.
And the preest schal schede the blood on the auter of the Lord, at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng; and he schal brenne the ynnere fatnesse in to odour of swetnesse to the Lord.
And thei schulen no more offre her sacrifices to fendis, with whiche thei diden fornycacioun; it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge to hem, and to the aftircomeris `of hem.
And thou schalt seie to hem, A man of the hows of Israel, and of the comelyngis that ben pilgryms among you, that offrith a brent sacrifice, ethir a slayn sacrifice,
and bryngith it not to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, that it be offrid to the Lord, schal perische fro his puple.
If ony man of the sones of Israel, and of comelyngis that ben pilgryms among you, etith blood, Y schal sette faste my face ayens `the soule of hym, and Y schal leese hym fro his puple;
for the lijf of fleisch is in blood, and Y yaf that blood to you, that ye clense on myn auter `for youre soulis, and that the blood be for the synne of soule.
Therfor Y seide to the sones of Israel, Ech lyuynge man of you schal not ete blood, nethir of the comelyngis that ben pilgryms among you.
What euer man of the sones of Israel, and of the comelyngis that ben pilgryms anentis you, takith a wielde beeste, ethir a brid, whiche it is leueful to ete, whether bi huntyng, whether bi haukyng, schede the blood therof, and hile it with erthe;
for the lijf of ech fleisch is in blood. Wherfor Y seide to the sones of Israel, Ye schulen not ete the blood of ony fleisch, for the lijf of fleisch is in blood, and who euer etith blood, schal perische.
A man that etith a thing deed bi it silf, ethir takun of a beeste, as wel of men borun in the lond, as of comelyngis, he schal waische hise clothis and hym silf in watir, and he schal be `defoulid til to euentid; and by this ordre he schal be maad cleene; that if he waischith not his clothis,
ether his bodi, he schal bere his wickidnesse.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seie to hem, Y am youre Lord God;
ye schulen not do by the custom of the lond of Egipt, in which ye dwelliden; ye schulen not do bi the custom of the cuntrei of Canaan, `to which Y schal brynge you yn, nethir ye schulen go in the lawful thingis of hem.
Ye schulen do my domes, and ye schulen kepe myn heestis, and ye schulen go in tho; Y am youre Lord God.
Kepe ye my lawis and domes, whiche a man `schal do, and schal lyue in tho; Y am youre Lord God.
Ech man schal not neiy to the nyy womman of his blood, that he schewe `the filthe of hir; Y am the Lord.
Thou schalt not diskyuere the filthe of thi fadir and the filthe of thi modir; sche is thi modir, thou schalt not schewe hir filthe.
Thou schalt not vnhile the filthe of the wijf of thi fadir, for it is the filthe of thi fadir.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of thi sistir, of fadir `ether of modir, which sister is gendrid at hoome ether without forth.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of the douyter of thi sone, ether of neece of thi douyter, for it is thi filthe.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of the douyter of the wijf of thi fadir, which sche childide to thi fadir, and is thi sistir.
Thou schalt not opene the filthe of the `sister of thi fadir, for sche is the fleisch of thi fadir.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of the sistir of thi modir, for sche is the fleisch of thi modir.
Thou schalt not shewe the filthe of the brothir of thi fadir, nethir thou schalt neiye to his wijf, which is ioyned to thee bi affinyte.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of thi sones wijf, for sche is the wijf of thi sone, nether thou schalt diskiuere hir schenschip; and no man take his brotheris wijf.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of `the wijf of thi brother, for it is the filthe of thi brothir.
Thou schalt not schewe the filthe of thi wijf, and of hir douyter; thou schalt not take the douytir of hir sone, and the douytir of hir douyter, that thou schewe hir schenschip; thei ben the fleisch of hir, and siche letcherie is incest.
Thou schalt not take `the sister of thi wijf, in to concubynage of hir, nethir thou schalt schewe `the filthe of hir, while thi wijf lyueth yit.
Thou schalt not neiye to a womman that suffrith rennyng of blood of monethe, nethir thou schalt schewe hir filthe.
Thou schalt not do letcherie with `the wijf of thi neiybore, nether thou schalt be defoulid with medlyng of seed.
Thou schalt not yyue of thi seed, that it be offrid to the idol Moloch, nether thou schalt defoule the name of thi God; Y am the Lord.
Thou schalt not be medlid with a man bi letcherie of womman, for it is abhomynacioun.
Thou schalt not do letcherie with ony beeste, nethir thou schalt be defoulid with it. A womman schal not ligge vnder a beeste, nether schal be medlid therwith, for it is greet synne.
Be ye not defoulid in alle these thingis, in whiche alle `folkis, ether hethen men, ben defoulid, whiche folkis Y schal caste out bifor youre siyt,
of whiche the lond is defoulid, of which lond Y schal vysyte the grete synnes, that it spewe out hise dwellers.
Kepe ye my lawful thingis and domes, that ye do not of alle these abhomynaciouns, as wel a man borun in the lond as a comelyng which is a pilgrym at you.
For the dwellers of the lond, that weren bifor you, diden alle these abhomynaciouns, and defouliden that lond.
Therfor be ye war, lest it caste out viliche also you in lijk manere, whanne ye han do lijk synnes, as it castide out vileche the folk, that was bifor you.
Ech man that doith ony thing of these abhomynaciouns, schal perische fro the myddis of his puple.
Kepe ye myn heestis; nyle ye do tho thingis, whiche thei that weren bifor you diden, and be ye not defoulid in tho; Y am youre Lord God.
The Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Speke thou to al the cumpenye of the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, Be ye hooli, for Y am hooli, youre Lord God.
Ech man drede his fadir and his modir. Kepe ye my sabatis; Y am youre Lord God.
Nyle ye be turned to ydols, nether ye schulen make to you yotun goddis; Y am youre Lord God.
If ye offren a sacrifice of pesible thingis to the Lord, that it be quemeful,
ye schulen ete it in that day, in which it is offrid, and in the tother dai; sotheli what euer thing is residue in to the thridde dai, ye schulen brenne in fier.
If ony man etith therof aftir twei daes, he schal be vnhooli, and gilti of vnfeithfulnes `ether wickidnesse; and he schal bere his wickidnesse,
for he defoulide the hooli thing of the Lord, and his soule schal perische fro his puple.
Whanne thou schalt repe the fruytis of thi lond, thou schalt not kitte `til to the ground the corn of the lond, nether thou schalt gadere the eeris of corn that ben left;
nethir in thi vyner thou schalt gadere reysyns and greynes fallynge doun, but thou schalt leeue to be gaderid of pore men and pilgryms; Y am youre Lord God.
Ye schulen not do thefte. Ye schulen not lye, and no man disseyue his neiybour.
Thou schalt not forswere in my name, nethir thou schalt defoule the name of thi God; Y am the Lord.
Thou schalt not make fals chalenge to thi neiybore, nethir thou schalt oppresse hym bi violence. The werk of thin hirid man schal not dwelle at thee til the morewtid.
Thou schalt not curse a deef man, nether thou schalt sette an hurtyng bifor a blynd man; but thou schalt drede thi Lord God, for Y am the Lord.
Thou schalt not do that, that is wickid, nether thou schalt deme vniustli; biholde thou not the persoone of a pore man, nethir onoure thou the face of a myyti man; deme thou iustli to thi neiybore.
Thou schalt not be a sclaunderere, nether a priuey bacbitere in the puplis; thou schalt not stonde ayens the blood of thi neiybore ; Y am the Lord.
Thou schalt not hate thi brothir in thin herte, but repreue hym opynly, lest thou haue synne on hym.
Thou schalt not seke veniaunce, nether thou schalt be myndeful of the wrong of thi cyteseyns; thou schalt loue thi freend as thi silf; Y am the Lord.
Kepe ye my lawis. Thou schalt not make thi beestis to gendre with the lyuynge beestis of another kynde. Thou schalt not sowe the feeld with dyuerse sede. Thou schalt not be clothid in a cloth, which is wouun of twei thingis.
If a man slepith with a womman by fleischly knowyng of seed, which womman is an `hand maide, ye, a noble womman of kyn, and netheles is not ayenbouyt bi prijs, nethir rewardid with fredom, bothe schulen be betun, and thei schulen not die, for sche was not fre.
Sotheli the man for his trespas schal offre a ram to the Lord, at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and the preest schal preye for hym, and for his trespas, bifor the Lord; and the Lord schal be merciful to hym, and the synne schal be foryouun.
Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of biheest, and han plauntid therynne appil trees, ye schulen do awei the firste flouris; the applis whiche tho trees bryngen forth, schulen be vncleene to you, nethir ye schulen ete of tho.
Forsothe in the fourthe yeer al the fruyt of tho trees schal be `halewid preiseful to the Lord;
forsothe in the fifthe yeer ye schulen ete fruytis, and schulen gadere applis, whiche tho trees bryngen forth; Y am youre Lord God.
Ye schulen not ete fleisch with blood. Ye schulen not make veyn diuynyng, nether ye schulen kepe dremes;
nether ye schulen clippe the heer in round, nether ye schulen schaue the beerd;
and on deed men ye schulen not kitte youre fleischis, nether ye schulen make to you ony fyguris, ether markis in youre fleisch; Y am the Lord.
Sette thou not thi douytir to do leccherie for hire, and the lond be defoulid, and be fillid with synne.
Kepe ye my sabatis, and drede ye my seyntuarie; Y `am the Lord.
Bowe ye not to astronomyers, nether axe ye ony thing of fals dyuynours, that ye be defoulid bi hem; Y am youre Lord God.
Rise thou bifor an hoor heed, and onoure thou the persoone of an eld man, and drede thou thi Lord God; Y am the Lord.
If a comelyng enhabitith in youre lond, and dwellith among you, dispise ye not hym,
but be he among you as a man borun in the lond; and ye schulen loue hym as you silf, for also ye weren comelyngis in the lond of Egipt; Y am youre Lord God.
Nyle ye do ony wickid thing in doom, in reule, in weiyte, and in mesure; the balance be iust,
and the weiytis be euene, the buschel be iust, and the sextarie be euene; Y am youre Lord God, that ladde you out of the lond of Egipt.
Kepe ye alle myn heestis, and alle domes, and do ye tho; Y am the Lord.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Speke thou these thingis to the sones of Israel, If eny man of the sones of Israel, and of the comelyngis that dwellen in Israel, yyueth of his seed to the ydol Moloch, die he bi deeth; the puple of the lond schal stone him.
And Y schal sette faste my face ayens hym, and Y schal kitte awei him fro the myddis of my puple, for he yaf of his seed to Moloch, and defoulide my seyntuarie, and defoulide myn hooli name.
That if the puple of the lond is necgligent, and as litil chargynge myn heeste, and suffrith the man that yaf of his seed to Moloch, nether wole sle hym, Y schal sette my face on that man,
and his kynrede, and Y schal kitte doun hym, and alle that consentiden to him, that thei schulden do fornycacioun with Moloch, fro the myddis of her puple.
If a man bowith to astronomyers, and false dyuynours, and doith fornycacioun with hem, Y schal sette my face ayens hym, and Y schal sle hym fro the mydis of hys puple.
Be ye halewid, and be ye hooli, for Y am hooli, youre Lord God.
Kepe ye myn heestis, and do ye tho, for Y am the Lord that halewe you.
He that cursith his fadir, ether modir, die bi deeth; if a man cursith fadir and modir, his blood be on hym.
If a man doith leccherie with `the wijf of another man, and doith auowtrie with `the wijf of his neiybore, bothe auowter and auowtresse die bi deeth.
If a man slepith with hys stepdamme, and schewith `the schenschip of his fadir, bothe die bi deeth; her blood be on hem.
If ony man slepith with `his sones wijf, euer either die, for thei han wrouyt greet synne; her blood be on hem.
If a man slepith with a man, bi letcherie of a womman, euer either hath wrouyt vnleueful thing, die thei bi deeth; her blood be on hem.
He that weddith ouer his wijf hir moder, hath wrouyt greet synne; he schal be brent quyk with hem, and so greet vnleueful doynge schal not dwelle in the myddis of you.
He that doith letcherie with a greet beeste, ethir a litil beeste die bi deeth, also sle ye the beeste.
A womman that liggith vndur ony beeste, be slayn togidere with it; the blood `of hem be on hem.
He that takith his sistir `the douytir of his fadir, ether the douyter of his modir, and seeth hir filthe, and sche seeth the schenschip of the brothir, thei han wrouyt an vnleueful thing, bothe schulen be slayn in the siyt of her puple; for thei schewiden togidere her filthe, and thei schulen bere her wickidnesse.
If a man doith fleischly knowyng with a womman in the flux of monethe, and schewith hir filthe, and sche openeth the welle of hir blood, bothe schulen be slayn fro the myddis of her puple.
Thou schalt not diskyuere the filthe of thi modris sistir, and of thi fadris sistir; he, that doith this, schal `make nakid the schenschip of his fleisch, and bothe schulen bere her wickidnesse.
He that doith fleischli knowyng with the wijf of `his fadris brother, ether of his modris brother, and schewith the filthe of his kyn, bothe schulen bere her synne, thei schulen die without fre children.
He that weddith `the wijf of his brother, doith an vnleueful thing; he schewide `the filthe of his brother, he schal be without fre children.
Kepe ye my lawis and my domes, and do ye tho, lest the lond, in to which ye schulen entre and dwelle, caste out viliche also you.
Nyle ye go in the lawful thingis of naciouns, whiche Y schal caste out bifor you, for thei diden alle these thingis, and Y hadde abhomynacioun of hem.
Forsothe Y speke to you, Welde ye `the lond of hem, which Y schal yyue to you in to eritage, the lond flowynge with mylk and hony; Y am youre Lord God, that departide you fro othere puplis.
Therfor also ye departe a cleene beeste fro vnclene, and a cleene brid fro vncleene, lest ye defoule youre soulis in a beeste, and in briddis, and in alle thingis that ben moued in erthe, and whiche thingis Y schewide to you to be defoulid.
Ye schulen be hooli to me, for `Y am the hooli Lord, and Y departide you fro othere puplis, that ye schulen be myne.
A man ethir a womman, in which is an vncleene spirit spekynge in the `wombe, ethir `a spirit of fals dyuynyng, die thei bi deeth; men schulen oppresse hem bi stoonus; her blood be on hem.
And the Lord seide to Moyses, Speke thou to preestis, the sones of Aaron, and thou schalt seie to hem, A preest be not defoulid in the deed men of hise citeseyns,
no but oneli in kynesmen and niy of blood, that is, on fadir and modir, and sone and douyter,
and brother and sister, virgyn, which is not weddid to man;
but nether he schal be defoulid in the prince of his puple.
Preestis schulen not schaue the heed, nether beerd, nether thei schulen make keruyngis in her fleischis; thei schulen be hooli to her God,
and thei schulen not defoule his name; for thei offren encense of the Lord, and the looues of her God, and therfore thei schulen be hooli.
A preest schal not wedde a wijf a corrupt womman, and a `foul hoore, nether he schal wedde `hir that is forsakun of the hosebonde, for he is halewid to his God,
and offrith the looues of settyng forth; therfor be he hooly, for `Y am the hooli Lord that halewith you.
If the `doutir of a preest is takun in defoulyng of virgynite, and defoulith the name of hir fadir, sche schal be brent in flawmes.
The bischop, that is the moost preest among hise britheren, on whose heed the oile of anoyntyng is sched, and whose hondis ben sacrid in preesthod, and he is clothid in hooli clothis, schal not diskyuere his heed, he schal not tere hise clothis,
and outirli he schal not entre to ony deed man; and he schal not be defoulid on his fadir and modir,
nether he schal go out of hooli thingis, lest he defoule the seyntuarie of the Lord, for the oile of hooli anoyntyng of his God is on hym; Y am the Lord.
He schal wedde a wijf virgyn;
he schal not take a widewe, and forsakun, and a foul womman, and hoore, but a damesele of his puple;
medle he not the generacioun of his kyn to the comyn puple of his folk, for Y am the Lord, that `halewe hym.
And the Lord spak to Moyses,
and seide, Speke thou to Aaron; a man of thi seed, bi meynes, that hath a wem, schal not offre breed to his God,
nethir schal neiy to his seruyce;
if he is blind; if he is crokid; if he is ether of litil, ether of greet, and wrong nose; if he is `of brokun foot, ethir hond;
if he hath a botche; ether if he is blereiyed; if he hath whijt colour in the iye, that lettith the siyt; if he hath contynuel scabbe; if he hath a drye scabbe in the bodi; ethir `is brokun `in the pryuy membris.
Ech man of the seed of Aaron preest, which man hath a wem, schal not neiye to offre sacrifices to the Lord, nether `to offre looues to his God;
netheles he schal ete the looues that ben offrid in the seyntuarie,
so oneli that he entre not with ynne the veil; he schal not neiye to the auter, for he hath a wem, and he schal not defoule my seyntuarie; Y am the Lord that halewe hem.
Therfor Moises spak to Aaron, and to hise sones, and to al Israel, alle thingis that weren comaundid to hym.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to Aaron and to hise sones,
that thei be war of these thingis of the sones of Israel, whiche thingis ben halewid; and that they defoule not the name of thingis halewid to me, whiche thingis thei offren; Y am the Lord.
Seie thou to hem, and to the aftir comeris of hem, Ech man of youre kynrede, `which man neiyeth to tho thingis that ben halewid, and whiche thingis the sones of Israel offreden to the Lord, in `which man is vnclennesse, schal perische bifor the Lord; Y am the Lord.
A man of the seed of Aaron, `which man is leprouse, ethir suffrith `fletyng out of seed, schal not ete of these thingis, that ben halewid to me, til he be heelid. He that touchith an vncleene thing on a deed bodi, and fro whom the seed as of leccherie goith out, and which touchith a crepynge beeste,
and what euer vncleene thing, whos touchyng is foul,
schal be vncleene `til to euentid, and he schal not ete these thingis, that ben halewid to me; but whanne he hath waische his fleisch in watir,
and the sunne hath go doun, thanne he schal be clensid, and schal ete halewid thingis, for it is his mete.
He schal not ete a thing deed bi it silf, and takun of a beeste, nethir he schal be defoulid in tho; Y am the Lord.
Thei schulen kepe myn heestis, that thei be not suget to synne, and die in the seyntuarye, whanne thei han defoulid it; Y am the Lord that halewe you.
Ech alien schal not ete of thingis halewid; the hyne which is a straunger, and the hirid man of the preest, schulen not ete of tho. Sotheli these seruauntis,
whom the preest hath bouyt, and which is a borun seruaunt of his hows, schulen ete of tho.
If the `douyter of the preest is weddid to ony of the puple, sche schal not ete of these thingis that ben halewid, and of the firste fruytis;
sotheli if sche is a widewe, ether forsakun, and turneth ayen with out fre children to `the hows of hir fadir, sche schal be susteyned bi the metis of hir fadir, as a damysel was wont; ech alien hath not power to ete of tho.
He that etith bi ignoraunce of halewid thingis, schal adde the fyuethe part with that that he eet, and `schal yyue to the preest in seyntuarie,
and thei schulen not defoule the halewid thingis of the sones of Israel, whiche thei offren to the Lord,
lest perauenture thei suffren the wickidnesse of her trespas, whanne thei han ete halewid thingis; Y am the Lord that `halewe hem.
The Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Speke thou to Aaron and to hise sones, and to alle the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, A man of the hous of Israel and of comelyngis that dwellen at hem, which offrith his offryng to the Lord, and ethir paieth avowis, ethir offrith bi his fre wille, what euer thing he offrith in to brent sacrifice of the Lord, that it be offrid bi you,
it schal be a male without wem, of oxen, and of scheep, and of geet; if it hath a wem,
ye schulen not offre, nether it schal be acceptable.
A man that offrith a sacrifice of pesyble thingis to the Lord, and ethir paieth auowis, ethir offrith bi fre wille, as wel of oxun as of scheep, he schal offre a beeste without wem, that it be acceptable; ech wem schal not be ther ynne.
If it is blynd, if it is brokun, if it hath a scar, if it hath whelkis, ether scabbe, ethir drie scabbe, ye schulen not offre tho beestis to the Lord, nether ye schulen brenne of tho beestis on the auter of the Lord.
A man may offre wilfuli an oxe and scheep, whanne the eere and tail ben kit of; but avow may not be paied of these beestis.
Ye schulen not offre to the Lord ony beeste, whose priuy membris ben brokun, ethir brisid, ether kit, and takun awey, and outerli ye schulen not do these thingis in youre lond.
Of `the hond of an alien ye schulen not offre looues to youre God, and what euer other thing he wole yyue, for alle thingis ben corrupt and defoulid; ye schulen not resseyue tho.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Whanne an oxe, scheep and goet ben brouyt forth `of the modris wombe, in seuene daies tho schulen be vnder `the tete of her modir; sotheli in the eiyte dai, and fro thennus forth, tho moun be offrid to the Lord,
whether thilke is a cow, whether `thilke is a scheep; tho schulen not be offrid in o dai with her fruytis.
If ye offren to the Lord a sacrifice for the doyng of thankyngis, that it mai be plesaunt,
ye schulen ete it in the same dai in which it is offrid; ony thing schal not leeue in the morewtid of the tother dai; Y am the Lord.
Kepe ye myn heestis, and do ye tho; Y am the Lord.
Defoule ye not myn hooli name, that Y be halewid in the myddis of the sones of Israel; Y am the Lord, that halewe you, and ledde you out of the lond of Egipt,
that Y schulde be to you in to God; Y am the Lord.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seye to hem, These ben the feries of the Lord, whiche ye schulen clepe hooli.
Sixe daies ye schulen do werk, the seuenthe dai schal be clepid hooli, for it is the reste of sabat; ye schulen not do ony werk ther ynne; it is the sabat of the Lord in alle youre abitaciouns.
These ben the hooli feries of the Lord, whiche ye owen to halewe in her tymes.
In the firste monethe, in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, is pask of the Lord;
and in the fiftenthe dai of this monethe is the solempnyte of therf looues of the Lord; seuene daies ye schulen ete therf looues;
the firste dai schal be moost solempne and hooli to you; ye schulen not do ony `seruyle werk ther ynne,
but ye schulen offre sacrifice in fier to the Lord seuene daies; sotheli the seuenthe dai schal be more solempne and hooliere, `that is, `than the formere daies goynge bitwixe, and ye schulen not do ony seruyle werk ther ynne.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seye to hem, Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond which Y schal yyue to you, and han rope corn, ye schulen bere handfuls of eeris of corn, the firste fruytis of youre rype corn, to the preest;
and the preest schal reise a bundel bifor the Lord, that it be acceptable for you, in the tother dai of sabat, that is, of pask; and the preest schal halewe that bundel;
and in the same dai, wher ynne the handful is halewid, a lomb of o yeer without wem schal be slayn in to brent sacrifice of the Lord;
and fletynge offryngis schulen be offrid ther with, twei tenthe partis of wheete flour spreynt to gidere with oile, in to encense of the Lord, and swettist odour, and fletynge offryngis of wyn, the fourthe part of hyn.
Ye schulen not ete a loof, nether a cake, nether podagis of the corn, `til to the dai in which ye schulen offre therof to youre God; it is a comaundement euerlastynge in youre generaciouns, and alle dwellyng placis.
Therfor ye schulen noumbre fro the tother dai of sabat, in which ye offriden handfullis of firste fruytis,
seuene fulle woukis, til to the tothir day of fillyng of the seuenthe wouk, that is, fifti dayes; and so ye schulen
offre newe sacrifice to the Lord of alle youre dwelling placis, twei looues of the firste fruytis, of twei tenthe partis of flour, `diyt with soure dow, whiche looues ye schulen bake in to the firste fruytis to the Lord.
And ye schulen offre with the looues seuene lambren of o yeer with out wem, and o calf of the droue, and twey rammes, and these schulen be in brent sacrifice, with her fletynge offryngis, in to swettest odour to the Lord.
Ye schulen make also a buk of geet for synne, and twey lambren of o yeer, sacrificis of pesible thingis.
And whanne the preest hath reisid tho, with the looues of firste fruytys bifor the Lord, tho schulen falle in to his vss.
And ye schulen clepe this dai most solempne, and moost hooli; ye schulen not do ther ynne ony seruyle werk; it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in alle youre dwellyngis, and generaciouns.
Forsothe aftir that ye han rope the corn of youre lond, ye schulen not kitte it `til to the ground, nether ye schulen gadere the `eeris of corn abidynge, but ye schulen leeue tho to pore men and pilgrymys; Y am `youre Lord God.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Speke thou to the sones of Israel, In the seuenthe monethe, in the firste day of the monethe, schal be sabat memorial to yow, sownynge with trumpis, and it schal be clepid hooli;
ye schulen not do ony seruyle werk ther ynne, and ye schulen offre brent sacrifice to the Lord.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, In the tenthe day of this seuenthe monethe,
the day of clensyngis schal be moost solempne, and it schal be clepid hooli; and ye schulen turmente youre soulis to God, and ye schulen offre brent sacrifice to the Lord;
ye schulen not do ony werk in the tyme of this day, for it is the day of the clensyng, that youre Lord God be merciful to you.
Ech `man which is not tourmentid in this day, schal perische fro his puplis,
and Y schal do a way fro his puple that man that doith eny thing of werk in that dai;
therfor ye schulen not do ony thing of werk in that dai; it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge to you in alle youre generaciouns and abitaciouns;
it is the sabat of restyng. Ye schulen turmente youre soulis fro the nynthe day of the monethe; fro euentid `til to euentid ye schulen halewe youre sabatis.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Fro the fiftenthe day of this seuenthe monethe schulen be the feries of tabernaclis, in seuene daies to the Lord;
the firste dai schal be clepid moost solempne and moost hooli, ye schulen not do ony seruyle werk ther ynne;
and in seuene daies ye schulen offre brent sacrifices to the Lord, and the eiythe dai schal be moost solempne and moost hooli; and ye schulen offre brent sacrifice to the Lord, for it is the day of cumpany, and of gaderyng; ye schulen not do ony seruyle werk ther ynne.
These ben the feries of the Lord, whiche ye schulen clepe moost solempne and moost hooli; and in tho ye schulen offre offryngis to the Lord, brent sacrifices, and fletynge offeryngis, bi the custom of ech day,
outakun the sabatis of the Lord, and youre yiftys, and whiche ye offren bi avow, ether whiche ye yyuen bi fre wille to the Lord.
Therfor fro the fiftenthe day of the seuenthe monethe, whanne ye han gaderid alle the fruytis of youre lond, ye schulen halewe the feries of the Lord seuene daies; in the firste day and the eiyte schal be sabat, that is, reste.
And ye schulen take to you in the firste day fruytis of the faireste tree, and braunchis of palm trees, and braunchis of a `tree of thicke boowis, and salewis of the rennynge streem, and ye schulen be glad bifor youre Lord God;
and ye schulen halewe his solempnyte seuene daies bi the yeer; it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns. In the seuenthe monethe ye schulen halewe feestis,
and ye schulen dwelle in schadewynge placis seuene daies; ech man that is of the kyn of Israel, schal dwelle in tabernaclis, that youre aftercomers lerne,
that Y made the sones of Israel to dwelle in tabernaculis, whanne Y ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt; Y am youre Lord God.
And Moises spak of the solempnytees of the Lord to the sones of Israel.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel,
that thei brynge to thee oile of olyues, pureste oile, and briyt, to the lanternes to be ordeyned contynueli with out the veil of witnessyng,
in the tabernacle of boond of pees; and Aaron schal araye tho lanternes fro euentid `til to euentid bifor the Lord, bi religioun and custom euerlastynge in youre generaciouns;
tho schulen be set euere on a clenneste candilstike in the siyt of the Lord.
Also thou schalt take wheete flour, and thou schalt bake therof twelue looues, which schulen haue ech bi hem silf twei tenthe partis,
of whiche thou schalt sette sexe on euer eithir side, on a clenneste boord bifor the Lord;
and thou schalt sette clereste encense on tho looues, that the looues be in to mynde of offryng of the Lord;
bi ech sabat tho schulen be chaungid bifor the Lord, and schulen be takun of the sones of Israel bi euerlastynge boond of pees;
and tho schulen be Aarons and hise sones, that thei ete tho in the hooli place, for it is hooli of the noumbre of hooli thingis, of the sacrifices of the Lord, bi euerlastynge lawe.
Lo! forsothe the sone of a womman of Israel, whom sche childide of a man Egipcian, yede out among the sones of Israel, and chidde in the castels with a man of Israel,
and whanne he hadde blasfemyd the name of the Lord, and hadde cursid the Lord, he was brouyt to Moises; forsothe his modir was clepid Salumyth, the douytir of Dabry, of the lynage of Dan;
and thei senten hym to prisoun, til thei wisten what the Lord comaundide.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
Lede out the blasfemere without the castels, and alle men that herden, sette her hondis on his heed, and al the puple stone hym.
And thou schalt speke to the sones of Israel, A man that cursith his God,
schal bere his synne, and he that blasfemeth the name of the Lord, die bi deeth; al the multitude of the puple schal oppresse hym with stoonus, whether he that blasfemede the name of the Lord is a citeseyn, whether a pilgrym, die he bi deeth.
He that smytith and sleeth a man, die bi deeth;
he that smytith a beeste, yelde oon in his stide, that is, lijf for lijf.
If a man yyueth a wem to ony of hise citeseyns, as he dide, so be it don to him;
he schal restore brekyng for brekyng, iye for iye, tooth for tooth; what maner wem he yaf, he schal be compellid to suffre sich a wem.
He that smytith werk beeste, yeelde another; he that smytith a man, schal be punyschid.
Euene doom be among you, whether a pilgrym ethir a citeseyn synneth, for Y am youre Lord God.
And Moyses spak to the sones of Israel, and thei brouyten forth out of the castels hym that blasfemede, and oppressiden with stoonus. And the sones of Israel diden, as the Lord comaundide to Moyses.
And the Lord spak to Moises in the hil of Synai,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seye to hem, Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond which Y schal yyue to you, `the erthe kepe the sabat of the Lord;
sixe yeeris thou schalt sowe thi feeld, and sixe yeeris thou schalt kitte thi vyner, and thou schalt gadere the fruytis ther of;
forsothe in the seuenthe yeer schal be sabat of the erthe of the restyng of the Lord;
thou schalt not sowe the feeld, and thou schalt not kitte the vyner, thou schalt not repe tho thingis whiche the erthe bryngith forth `bi fre wille, and thou schalt not gadere the grapis of thi firste fruytis, as vyndage; for it is the yeer of restyng of the lond; but tho schulen be to you in to mete,
to thee, and to thi seruaunt, to thin handmaide, and to thin hirid man, and to the comelyng which is a pilgrym at thee; alle thingis that `comen forth,
schulen yyue mete to thi werk beestis and smale beestis.
Also thou schalt noumbre to thee seuene woukis of yeeris, that is, seuene sithes seuene, whiche togidere maken nyn and fourti yeer;
and thou schalt sowne with a clarioun in the seuenthe monethe, in the tenthe dai of the monethe, in the tyme of propiciacioun, `that is, merci, in al youre lond.
And thou schalt halewe the fiftithe yeer, and thou schalt clepe remissioun to alle the dwellers of thi lond; for thilke yeer is iubilee; a man schal turne ayen to hys possessioun, and ech man schal go ayen to the firste meynee,
for it is iubilee, and the fiftithe yeer. Ye schulen not sowe, nether ye schulen repe thingis, that comen forth freli in the feeld, and ye schulen not gadere the firste fruytis of vyndage, for the halewyng of iubilee;
but anoon ye schulen ete thingis takun awey;
in the yeer of iubilee alle men go ayen to her possessiouns.
Whanne thou schalt sille ony thing to thi citeseyn, ether schalt bie of hym, make thou not sory thi brother, but bi the noumbre of `yeeris of iubile thou schalt bie of him,
and bi the rekenyng of fruytis he schal sille to thee.
Bi as myche as mo yeeris dwellen after the iubilee, by so myche also the prijs schal encreesse, and bi as myche as thou noumbrist lesse of tyme, bi so myche and the biyng schal cost lesse; for he schal sille to thee the time of fruytis.
Nyle ye turment men of youre lynagis, but ech man drede his God; for Y am youre Lord God.
Do ye my comaundementis, and kepe ye my domes, and fille ye tho, that ye moun dwelle in his lond without ony drede,
and that the erthe brynge forth hise fruytis to you, whiche ye schulen ete `til to fulnesse, and drede not the assailyng of ony man.
That if ye seien, what schulen we ete in the seuenthe yeer, if we sowen not, nether gaderen oure fruytis?
Y schal yyue my blessyng to you in the sixte yeer, and it schal make fruytis of three yeer;
and ye schulen sowe in the eiyte yeer, and ye schulen ete elde fruytis `til to the nynthe yeer; til newe thingis comen forth ye schulen ete the elde thingis.
Also the lond schal not be seeld `in to with outen ende, for it is myn, and ye ben my comelyngis and tenauntis;
wherfor al the cuntre of youre possessioun schal be seeld vndur the condicioun of ayenbiyng.
If thi brother is maad pore, and sillith his litil possessioun, and his nyy kynesman wole, he may ayenbie that that he seelde;
sotheli if he hath no nyy kynesman, and he may fynde prijs to ayenbie,
the fruytis schulen be rekynyd fro that tyme in which he seelde, and he schal yelde `that that is residue to the biere, and he schal resseyue so his possessioun.
That if his hond fynde not, that he yelde the prijs, the biere schal haue that that he bouyte, `til to the yeer of iubilee; for in that yeer ech sillyng schal go ayen to the lord, and to the firste weldere.
He that sillith his hows, with ynne the wallis of a citee, schal haue licence to ayenbie til o yeer be fillid;
if he ayenbieth not, and the sercle of the yeer is passid, the biere schal welde it, and his eiris `in to with outen ende, and it schal not mow be ayenbouyt, ye, in the iubilee.
Forsothe if the hows is in a town `that hath not wallis, it schal be seeld bi the lawe of feeldis; sotheli if it is not ayenbouyt in the iubilee, it schal turne ayen to `his lord.
The howsis of dekenes, that ben in citees, moun euer be ayenbouyt; if tho ben not ayenbouyt,
tho schulen turne ayen in the iubilee `to the lordis; for the `howsis of the citees of dekenes ben for possessiouns among the sones of Israel;
forsothe the suburbabis of hem schulen not be seeld, for it is euerlastynge possessioun.
If thi brother is maad pore, and feble in power, and thou resseyuest hym as a comelyng and pilgrym, and he lyueth with thee,
take thou not vsuris of hym, nether more than thou hast youe; drede thou thi God, that thi brothir mai lyue anentis thee.
Thou schalt not yyue to hym thi money to vsure, and thou schalt not axe ouer `aboundaunce, ether encrees ouer of fruytis;
Y am youre Lord God, that ladde you out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde yyue to you the lond of Canaan, and that Y schulde be youre God.
If thi brother compellid bi pouert sillith hym silf to thee, thou schalt not oppresse hym bi seruage of seruauntis,
but he schal be as an hirid man and tenaunt; `til to the yeer of iubilee he schal worche at thee,
and aftirward he schal go out with his fre children, and he schal turne ayen to the kynrede, and to `the possessioun of his fadris.
For thei ben my seruauntis, and Y ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt; thei schulen not be seeld bi the condicioun of seruauntis;
turmente thou not hem bi thi power, but drede thou thi Lord.
A seruaunt and handmaide be to you of naciouns that ben in youre cumpas,
and of comelyngis that ben pilgrimys at you, ether thei that ben borun of hem in youre lond; ye schulen haue these seruauntis,
and bi riyt of eritage ye schulen `sende ouer to aftir comeris, and ye schulen welde with outen ende; sothely oppresse ye not bi power youre britheren, the sones of Israel.
If the hond of a comelyng and of a pilgrim wexith strong at you, and thi brother is maad pore, and sillith hym silf to hym,
ether to ony of his kyn, he may be ayenbouyt aftir the sillyng; he that wole of hise britheren, ayenbie hym; bothe `the brother of fadir,
and the sone of `the fadris brother, and kynesman, and alye. Ellis if also he schal mow, he schal ayenbie hym silf,
while the yeeris ben rykenid oneli fro the tyme of his sillyng `til in to the yeer of iubylee; and while the money, for which he was seeld, is rikenyd bi the noumbre of yeeris, and while the hire of an hirid man is rikenyd.
If mo yeeris ben that dwellen `til to the iubilee, bi these yeeris he schal yelde also the prijs; if fewe yeeris ben,

and he schal yeelde to the biere that that is residue of yeeris, while tho yeeris, bi whiche he seruyde bifore, ben rikenyd for hiris; he schal not turmente `that Ebreu violentli in thi siyt.
That if he may not be ayenbouyt bi this, he schal go out with his free children in the `yeer of iubilee; for the sones of Israel ben myn seruauntis,
whiche Y ledde out of the lond of Egipt.
Y am youre Lord God; ye schulen not make to you an ydol, and a grauun ymage, nether ye schulen reise titlis, nether ye schulen sette a noble stoon in youre lond, that ye worschipe it; for Y am youre Lord God.
Kepe ye my sabatis, and drede ye at my seyntuarie; Y am the Lord.
If ye gon in myn heestis, and kepen my comaundementis, and doon tho, Y schal yyue to you reynes in her tymes,
and the erthe schal brynge forth his fruyt, and trees schulen be fillid with applis;
the threschyng of ripe cornes schal take vyndage, and vyndage schal occupie seed, and ye schulen ete youre breed in fulnesse, and ye schulen dwelle in youre lond without drede.
Y schal yyue pees in youre coostis; ye schulen slepe, and noon schal be that schal make you aferd; Y schal do awei yuel beestis fro you, and a swerd schal not passe bi youre termes.
Ye schulen pursue youre enemyes, and thei schulen falle bifor you;
fyue of youre men schulen pursue an hundrid aliens, and an hundrid of you schulen pursue ten thousande; youre enemyes schulen falle bi swerd in youre siyt.
Y schal biholde you, and Y schal make you to encreesse; ye schulen be multiplied; and Y schal make stedfast my couenaunt with you;
ye schulen ete the eldest of elde thingis, and ye schulen caste forth elde thingis, whanne newe thingis schulen come aboue;
Y schal sette my tabernacle in the myddis of you, and my soule schal not caste you awey;
Y schal go among you, and Y schal be youre God, and ye schulen be a puple to me.
Y am youre Lord God, that ledde you out of the lond of Egipcians, that ye schulden not serue hem, and which haue broke the chaynes of youre nollis, that ye schulde go vpriyt.
That if ye heren not me, nether doon alle myn heestis,
and if ye forsaken my lawis, and despisen my domes, that ye doon not tho thingis that ben ordeyned of me, and that ye brengen my couenaunt to auoydyng, also Y schal do these thingis to you;
Y schal visyte you swiftly in nedynesse and brennyng, which schal turment youre iyen, and schal waste youre lyues; in veyn ye schulen sowe seed, that schal be deuourid of enemyes;
Y schal sette my face ayens you, and ye schulen falle bifor youre enemyes, and ye schulen be sugetis to hem that haten you; ye schulen fle, while no man pursueth.
But if nether so ye obeyen to me, Y schal adde youre chastisyngis seuenfold for youre synnes;
and Y schal al tobreke the pride of youre hardnesse, and Y schal yyue to you heuene aboue as of yrun, and the erthe as bras;
youre trauel schal be wastid in veyn, nether the erthe schal brynge forth fruyt, nethir trees schulen yyue applis.
If ye goon contrarie to me, nether wolen here me, Y schal adde youre woundis til in to seuenfold for youre synnes;
Y schal sende out in to you cruel beestis of the feeld, that schulen waste you and youre beestis, and schulen brynge alle thingis to fewnesse, and youre weies schulen be forsakun.
That if nether so ye wolen resseyue doctryn, but goon contrarie to me,
also Y schal go aduersarie ayens you, and Y schal smyte you seuen sithis for youre synnes;
and Y schal brynge yn on you the swerd, vengere of my boond of pees ; and whanne ye fleen in to citees, Y schal sende pestilence in the myddis of you, and ye schulen be bitakun in the hondis of enemyes,
aftir that Y haue broke the staf of youre breed, so that ten wymmen bake looues in oon ouene, and yelde tho looues at weiyte; and ye schulen ete, and ye schulen not be fillid.
But if nethir bi these thingis ye heren me, but goon ayens me,
and Y schal go ayens you in contrarie woodnesse, and Y schal chastise you bi seuene veniaunces for youre synnes,
so that ye ete the fleischis of youre sones, and of youre douytris;
Y schal destrie youre hiye thingis, and Y schal breke youre symylacris; ye schulen falle bitwixe the fallyngis of your ydols, and my soule schal haue you abhomynable,
in so myche that Y turne youre citees in to wildirnesse, and make youre seyntuaries forsakun, nether Y schal resseyue more the swettest odour;
and Y schal destrye youre lond, and youre enemyes schulen be astonyed theronne, whanne thei schulen be enhabiters therof;
forsothe Y schal scatere you in to folkis, ether hethen men, and Y schal drawe out of the schethe the swerd aftir you, and youre lond schal be forsakun, and youre citees schulen be cast doun.
Thanne `hise sabatis schulen plese the erthe, in alle the daies of his wildirnesse; whanne ye ben in the lond of enemyes,
it schal `kepe sabat, and schal reste in the sabatis of his wildirnesse, for it restide not in youre sabatis, whanne ye dwelliden therynne.
And Y schal yyue drede in `the hertis of hem, whiche schulen abide of you, in the cuntreis of enemyes; the sown of a leef fleynge schal make hem aferd, and so thei schulen fle it as a swerd; thei schulen falle, while noon pursueth,
and alle schulen falle on her britheren, as fleynge bateils; no man of you schal be hardi to ayenstonde enemyes;
ye schulen perische among hethen men, and the lond of enemyes schal waaste you.
That if summe of these Jewes dwellen, thei schulen faile in her wickidnessis, in the lond of her enemyes, and thei schulen be turmentid for the synne of her fadris,
and for her owne synnes, til thei knoulechen her wickidnesses, and han mynde of her yuels, bi whiche thei trespassiden ayens me, and yeden contrarie to me.
Therfor and Y schal go ayens hem, and Y schal brynge hem in to the lond of enemyes, til the vncircumcidid soule of hem be aschamed; thanne thei schulen preie for her wickidnesses,
and Y schal haue mynde of my boond of pees, which Y couenauntide with Jacob, Ysaac, and Abraham; also Y schal be myndeful of the lond,
which, whanne it is left of hem, schal plese to it silf in `his sabatis, and schal suffre wildirnesse for hem; forsothe thei schulen preye for her synnes, for thei castiden awey my domes, and despyseden my lawis;
netheles, yhe, whanne thei weren in `the lond of enemyes, Y castide not hem awey outirli, nether Y dispiside hem, so that thei weren wastid, and that Y made voide my couenaunt with hem; for Y am the Lord God of hem.
And Y schal haue mynde of my formere boond of pees, whanne Y ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt, in the siyt of hethene men, that Y schulde be her God; Y am the Lord God.
These ben the comaundementis, and domes, and lawis, whiche the Lord yaf bitwixe hym silf and bitwixe the sones of Israel, in the hil of Synay, bi the hond of Moises.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seye to hem, A man that makith avow, and bihetith his soule to God, schal yyue the priys vndur valu, ether preisyng.
If it is a male, fro the twentithe yeer `til to the sixtithe yeer, he schal yyue fifti siclis of siluer, at the mesure of seyntuarie, if it is a womman,
sche schal yyue thretti siclis;
forsothe fro the fifthe yeer `til to the twentithe yeer, a male schal yyue twenti cyclis, a womman schal yyue ten ciclis;
fro o monethe `til to the fifthe yeer, fyue ciclis schulen be youun for a male, thre ciclis for a womman;
a male of sixti yeer and ouer schal yyue fiftene ciclis, a womman schal yyue ten cyclis.
If it is a pore man, and may not yelde the valu, he schal stonde bifor the preest, and as myche as the preest preisith, and seeth that the pore man may yelde, so myche he schal yyue.
Forsothe if ony man avowith a beeste, that may be offrid to the Lord, it schal be hooli,
and schal not mow be chaungid, that is, nethir a betere for `an yuel, nether `a worse for a good; and if he chaungith it, bothe that, that is chaungid, and that, for which it is chaungid, schal be halewid to the Lord.
Sotheli if ony man avowith an vncleene beeste, that may not be offrid to the Lord, it schal be brouyt bifor the preest,
and the preest schal deme whether it is good ether yuel, and schal sette the prijs;
which prijs if he that offrith wole yyue, he schal adde the fifthe part ouer the valu.
If a man avowith his hows, and halewith it to the Lord, the preest schal biholde, `whether it is good ether yuel, and bi the prijs, which is ordeyned of hym, it schal be seld;
sotheli if he that avowide wole ayen-bie it, he schal yyue the fifthe part of the valu aboue, and he schal haue the hows.
That if he avowith the feeld of his possessioun, and halewith to the Lord, the prijs schal be demed bi the mesure of seed; if the feeld is sowun with thritti buyschels of barli, it schal be seeld for fifti siclys of siluer.
If he auowith the feeld anoon for the yeer of the iubilee bigynnynge, as myche as it may be worth, bi so myche it schal be preisid;
but if it be after `sum part of tyme, the preest schal rykene the money bi the noumbre of yeeris that ben residue `til to the iubilee, and it schal be withdrawun of the prijs.
That if he that avowide wole ayenbie the feeld, he schal adde the fyuethe part of the money preisid, and he schal welde it;
but if he nyle ayenbie, but it is seeld to ony othir man, he that avowide schal `no more mowe ayenbie it;
for whanne the dai of iubilee cometh, it schal be halewid to the Lord, and the possessioun halewid perteyneth to the riyt of preestis.
If the feeld is bouyt, and is not of the possessioun of grettere men,
and is halewid to the Lord, the preest schal determyne the prijs bi the noumbre of yeeris `til to the iubilee, and he that avowide the feeld schal yyue the prijs to the Lord;
forsothe in the iubilee it schal turne ayen to the formere lord that seelde it, and `haue he in to the eritage of his possessioun.
`Ech preisyng schal be peisid bi the sicle of seyntuarie; a sicle hath twenti halpens.
No man may halewe and avowe the firste gendrid thingis that perteynen to the Lord, whether it is oxe, whether scheep, tho ben the Lordis part.
That if the beeste is vncleene, he that offride schal ayenbie by his valu, and he schal adde the fyuethe part of prijs; if he nyle ayenbie, it schal be seeld to another man, as myche euer as it is `set at valu.
Al thing which is halewid to the Lord, whether it is man, whether beeste, whether feeld, it schal not be seeld, nether it schal mow be ayenbouyt; whateuer thing is halewid onys, it schal be hooli of the noumbre of hooli thingis to the Lord,
and ech halewyng which is offrid of man, schal not be ayenbouyt, but it schal die bi deeth.
Alle the tithis of erthe, whether of fruytis, whether of applis of trees, ben the Lordis part, and ben halewid to hym;
sotheli if ony man wole ayenbie hise tithis, he schal adde the fyuethe part of tho; of alle tithis,
of scheep, and of oxen, and of geet, that passen vndur the `yerde of scheepherde, whateuer thing cometh to the tenthe part, it schal be halewid to the Lord;
it schal not be chosun, nether good, nether yuel; nethir it schal be chaungid for another; if ony man chaungith, bothe that, that is chaungid, and that, for which it is chaungid, schal be halewid to the Lord, and it schal not be ayenbouyt.

And the Lord seide to Moises, Noumbre thou the firste gendrid children of male kynde of the sones of Israel, fro o monethe and aboue; and thou schalt haue the summe of hem; and
thou schalt take Leuytis to me for alle the firste gendrid of the sones of Israel; Y am the Lord; and thou schalt take `the beestis of hem for alle the firste gendrid of the sones of Israel.
And as the Lord comaundide, Moises noumbride the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel; and the males weren bi her names,
fro o monethe and aboue, two and twenti thousynde two hundrid and seuenti and thre.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Take thou Leuytis for the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel, and the beestis of Leuytis for the beestis of hem, and the Leuytis schulen be myne; Y am the Lord.
Forsothe in the prijs of two hundrid seuenti and thre, that passen the noumbre of `Leuytis, of the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel,
thou schalt take fyue ciclis bi ech heed, at the mesure of seyntuarie; a sicle hath xx. halpens;
and thou schalt yyue the money to Aaron and to hise sones, the prijs of hem that ben aboue.
Therfor Moises took the money of hem that weren aboue, and whiche thei hadden ayenbouyt of the Leuytis, for the firste gendrid of the sones of Israel,
a thousand thre hundrid sixti and fyue of siclis, bi the weiyte of seyntuarie;
and he yaf that money to Aaron and to hise sones, bi the word which the Lord comaundide to hym.
And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron,
and seide, Take thou the summe of the sones of Caath, fro the myddis of Leuytis,
bi her housis and meynees, fro the threttithe yeer and aboue `til to the fiftithe yeer, of alle that entren, that thei stonde and mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees.
This is the religioun of the sones of Caath; Aaron and his sones schulen entren in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, and in to the hooli of hooli thingis,
whanne the tentis schulen be moued; and thei schulen do doun the veil that hangith bifore the yatis, and thei schulen wlappe in it the arke of witnessyng;
and thei schulen hile eft with a veil of `skynnys of iacynt, and thei schulen stretche forth aboue a mentil al of iacynt, and thei schulen putte in barris `on the schuldris of the bereris.
Also thei schulen wlappe the boord of proposicioun in a mentil of iacynt, and thei schulen putte therwith cenceris, and morteris of gold, litil cuppis, and grete cuppis to fletyng sacrifices `to be sched; looues schulen euere be in the boord.
And thei schulen strecche forth aboue a reed mentil, which thei schulen hile eft with an hilyng of `skynnes of iacynt, and thei schulen putte yn barris.
Thei schulen take also a mentil of iacynt with which thei schulen hile the candilstike, with hise lanternes, and tongis, and snytels, and alle the `vessels of oile that ben nedeful to the lanternes to be ordeyned;
and on alle thingis thei schulen putte an hilyng of `skynnys of iacynt, and thei schulen putte in barris.
Also and thei schulen wlappe the goldun auter in a clooth of iacynt; and thei schulen stretche forth aboue an hilyng of `skynnys of iacynt, and thei schulen putte in barris.
Thei schulen wlappe in a mentil of iacynt alle the vessels in whiche it is mynystrid in the seyntuarie, and thei schulen strecche forth aboue an hilyng of `skynnys of iacynt, and thei schulen putte yn barris.
But also thei schulen clense the auter fro aische, and thei schulen wlappe it in a clooth of purpur.
And thei schulen putte with it alle vessels whiche thei vsen in the seruyce therof, that is, ressettis of firis, tongis, and fleischokis, hokis, and censeris, ether pannys of coolis; thei schulen hile alle the vessels of the auter togidere in a veil of `skynnes of iacynt, and thei schulen putte in barris.
And whanne Aaron and hise sones han wlappid the seyntuarie, and alle vessels therof, in the mouyng of tentis, thanne the sones of Caath schulen entre, that thei bere the thingis wlappid, and touche not the vessels of the seyntuarie, lest thei dien.
Thes ben the birthuns of the sones of Caath, in the tabernacle of boond of pees, on whiche Eleazar, the sone of Aaron, preest, schal be; to whois cure `the oile perteyneth to ordeyne lanternes, and the encense which is maad bi craft, and the sacrifice which is offrid euere, and the oile of anoyntyng, and what euere thing perteyneth to the ournyng of the tabernacle, and of alle vessels that ben in the seyntuarie.
And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron, and seide,
Nyle ye leese the puple of Caath fro the myddis of Leuytis;
but do ye this thing to hem, that thei lyue, and die not, if thei touchen the hooli of hooli thingis. Aaron and hise sones schulen entre, and thei schulen dispose the werkis of alle men, and thei schulen departe `what who owith to bere.
Othere men se not bi ony curiouste tho thingis that ben in the seyntuarie, bifore that tho ben wlappid; ellis thei schulen die.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Take thou the summe also of the sones of Gerson, bi her housis, and meynees, and kynredis; noumbre thou
fro thretti yeer and aboue `til to fifti yeer alle that entren and mynystren in the tabernacle of boond of pees.
This is the office of the sones of Gersonytis, that thei bere the curteyns of the tabernacle, and the roof of the boond of pees, an other hilyng,
and a veil of iacynt aboue alle thingis, and the tente which hangith in the entryng of the tabernacle of the boond of pees;
and the curteyns of the greet street, and the veil in the entryng, `which veil is bifor the tabernacle.
Whanne Aaron comaundith and hise sones, the sones of Gerson schulen bere alle thingis that perteynen to the auter, the coordis, and vessels of seruyce ; and alle schulen wite, to what charge thei owen to be boundun.
This is the office of the meynee of Gersonytis, in the tabernacle of boond of pees; and thei schulen be vndur the hond of Ythamar, the sone of Aaron, preest.
Also thou schalt noumbre the sones of Merary, bi the meynees and housis of her fadris,
fro thretti yeer and aboue `til to fifti yeer, alle that entren to the office of her seruice, and to the ournyng of the boond of pees of witnessyng.
These ben `the chargis of hem; thei schulen bere the tablis of the tabernacle, and the barris therof, the pilers and her foundementis; also the pilers of the greet street bi cumpas,
with her foundementis, and her stakis, and coordis; thei schulen take alle instrumentis and purtenaunce at noumbre, and so thei schulen bere.
This is the office of `the meynee of Meraritis, and the seruyce in the tabernacle of boond of pees; and thei schulen be vndur the hond of Ythamar, the sone of Aaron, preest.
Therfor Moises and Aaron and the princes of the synagoge noumbriden the sones of Caath, bi the kynredis and housis of her fadris,
fro thretti yeer and aboue `til to the fiftithe yeer, alle that entren to the seruyce of the tabernacle of boond of pees;
and thei weren foundun two thousynde seuene hundrid and fifti.
This is the noumbre of the puple of Caath, which entrith in to the tabernacle of boond of pees; Moises and Aaron noumbriden these, bi the word of the Lord, bi the hond of Moises.
And the sones of Gerson weren noumbrid, bi the kyneredis and housis of her fadris,
fro thretti yeer and aboue `til to `the fiftithe yeer, alle that entren that thei mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees;
and thei weren foundun two thousynde sixe hundrid and thretti.
This is the puple of Gersonytis, which Moises and Aaron noumbriden, bi the `word of the Lord.
And the sones of Merary weren noumbrid, bi the kynredis and housis of her fadris,
fro threttithe yeer and aboue `til to `the fiftithe yere, alle that entren to fille the customs, ether seruices, of the tabernacle of boond of pees;
`and thei weren foundun thre thousynde and two hundrid.
This is the noumbre of the sones of Merari, whiche Moyses and Aaron noumbriden, bi `the comaundement of the Lord, bi the hoond of Moises.
Alle that weren noumbrid of Leuytis, and whiche Moyses and Aaron and the princes of Israel maden to be noumbrid, bi the kynredis and housis of her fadris,
fro thretti yeer and aboue `til to `the fiftithe yeer, and entriden to the seruyce of the tabernacle, and to bere chargis,
weren togidere eiyte thousynde fyue hundrid and foure scoor.
By the `word of the Lord Moises noumbride hem, ech man bi his office and hise chargis, as the Lord comaundide to hym.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel,
that thei caste out of the castels ech leprouse man, and that fletith out seed, and is defoulid on a deed bodi; caste ye out of the castels,
as wel a male as a female, lest thei defoulen tho, whanne thei dwellen with you.
And the sones of Israel diden so; and thei castiden hem out of the castels, as the Lord spak to Moises.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Whanne a man ethir a womman han do of alle synnes that ben wont to falle to men, and han broke bi necgligence the `comaundement of the Lord,
and han trespassid, thei schulen knowleche her synne, and thei schulen yelde thilke heed, and the fyuethe part aboue, to hym ayens whom thei synneden.
But if noon is that schal resseyue thei schulen yyue to the Lord, and it schal be the preestis part, outakun the ram which is offrid for clensyng, that it be a quemeful sacrifice.
Also alle the firste fruytis, whiche the sones of Israel offren, perteynen to the preest;
and what euer thing is offrid of ech man in the seyntuarie, and is youun to the `hondis of the preest, it schal be the preestis part.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, If `the wijf of a man hath errid, and hath dispisid the hosebonde,
and hath slept with another man, and the hosebonde may not take ether preue this, but the auowtrye is hid, and may not be preuyd bi witnessis, for sche is not foundun in leccherie;
if the spirit of gelousie stirith the housebonde ayens his wijf, which is ether defoulid, ethir is apechid bi fals suspecioun,
the man schal brynge hir to the preest, and he schal offre an offryng for hir `the tenthe part of a mesure clepid satum of barli meele; he schal not schede oyle ther onne, nethir he schal putte encense, for it is the sacrifice of gelousie, and an offryng enquerynge auowtrye.
Therfor the preest schal offre hir, and schal sette bifore the Lord;
and he schal take holi watir in `a vessel of erthe, and he schal putte in to it a litil of the erthe of the pawment of the tabernacle.
And whanne the womman stondith in the siyt of the Lord, he schal diskyuere hir heed, and he schal putte `on the hondis of hir the sacrifice of remembryng, and the offryng of gelousie. Sotheli he schal holde moost bittir watris, in whiche he gaderide togidere cursis with cursyng.
And he schal conioure hir, and schal seie, If an alien man slepte not with thee, and if thou art not defoulid in the forsakyng the bed of the hosebonde, these bittereste watris schulen not anoye thee, in to whiche Y haue gaderid togidere cursis;
ellis if thou bowidst awei fro thin hosebonde, and art defoulid, and hast leyn with another man,
thou schalt be suget to these cursyngys; the Lord yyue thee in to cursyng, and in to ensaumple of alle men in his puple; `the Lord make thin hipe to wexe rotun, and thi wombe swelle, and be brokun;
cursid watris entre in to thi wombe, and while the wombe swellith, thin hipe wexe rotun. And the womman schal answere, Amen! amen!
And the preest schal write thes cursis in a litil book, and he schal do awey tho cursis with bittereste watris, in to whiche he gaderide cursis,
and he schal yyue to hir to drynke. And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris,
the preest schal take of hir hond the sacrifice of gelousie, and he schal reise it bifor the Lord, and he schal putte on the auter;
so oneli that he take bifore an handful of sacrifice `of that that is offrid, and brenne on the auter, and so yyue drynke to the womman the moost bittere watris.
And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris, if sche is defoulid, and is gilti of auowtrie, for the hosebonde is dispisid, the watris of cursyng schulen passe thorouy hir, and while the wombe is bolnyd, the hipe schal wexe rotun, and the womman schal be in to cursyng and in to ensaumple to al the puple.
That if sche is not pollutid, sche schal be harmeles, and schal brynge forth fre children.
This is the lawe of gelousie, if a womman bowith awei fro hir hosebonde, and is defoulid,
and the hosebonde is stirid with the spirit of gelousye, and bryngith hir in to the `siyt of the Lord, and the preest doith to hir bi alle thingis that ben writun, the hosebonde schal be with out synne,
and sche schal resseyue hir wickidnesse.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne a man ether a womman makith auow, that thei be halewid, and thei wolen halewe hem silf to the Lord,
thei schulen absteyne fro wyn and fro al thing that may make drunkun; thei schulen not drynke vynegre of wyn, and of ony other drynkyng, and what euer thing is pressid out of the grape; thei schulen not ete freisch grapis and drie,
alle dayes in whiche thei ben halewid bi a vow to the Lord; thei schulen not ete what euer thing may be of the vyner, fro a grape dried `til to the draf.
In al tyme of his departyng a rasour schal not passe on his heed, `til to the day fillid in which he is halewid to the Lord; he schal be hooli while the heer of his heed `schal wexe.
In al the tyme of his halewing he schal not entre on a deed bodi,
and sotheli he schal not be defoulid on the deed bodi of fadir and of moder, of brothir and of sistir, for the halewyng of his God is on his heed;
ech dai of his departyng schal be hooli to the Lord.
But if ony man is deed sudeynly bifore hym, the heed of his halewyng schal be defoulid, which he schal schaue anoon in the same dai of his clensyng, and eft in the seuenthe dai;
forsothe in the eiyte dai he schal offre twei turtlis, ether twei `briddis of a culuer, to the preest, in the entryng of the boond of pees of witnessyng.
And the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preie for hym, for he synnede on a deed bodi, and he schal halewe his heed in that dai.
And he schal halewe to the Lord the daies of his departyng, and he schal offre a lomb of o yeer for synne, so netheles that the formere daies be maad voide, for his halewyng is defoulid.
This is the lawe of consecracioun. Whanne the daies schulen be fillid, whiche he determynede by a vow, the preest schal brynge hym to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and schal offre his offryng to the Lord,
a lomb of o yeer with out wem, in to brent sacrifice, and a scheep of o yeer with outen wem, for synne, and a ram with out wem, a pesible sacrifice;
also a panyere of theerf looues, that ben spreynt togidere with oile, and cakis sodun in watir, and aftir anoyntid with oile, with out sourdow, and fletyng sacrifices of alle bi hem silf;
whiche the preest schal offre bifor the Lord, and schal make as wel for synne as in to brent sacrifice.
Sotheli he schal offre the ram a pesible sacrifice to the Lord, and he schal offre togidere a panyere of therf looues and fletyng sacryfices, that ben due bi custom.
Thanne the Nazarei schal be schauun fro the heer of his consecracioun, bifor the doore of the tabernacle of boond of pees; and the preest schal take hise heeris, and schal putte on the fier, which is put vndur the sacrifice of pesible thingis.
And he schal take the schuldur sodun of the ram, and o `cake of breed with out sourdow fro the panyere, and o theerf caak first sodun in watir and aftirward fried in oile, and he schal bitake in the hondis of the Nazarei, aftir that his heed is schauun.
And the preest schal reise in the `siyt of the Lord the thingis takun eft of hym. And the thingis halewid schulen be the preestis part, as the brest which is comaundid to be departid, and the hipe. Aftir these thingis the Nasarey may drynke wyn.
This is the lawe of the Nasarei, whanne he hath avowyd his offryng to the Lord in the tyme of his consecracioun, outakun these thingis whiche his hond fyndith. By this that he avowide in soule, so he schal do, to the perfeccioun of his halewyng.
And the Lord spak to Moyses and seide,
Speke thou to Aaron and to hise sones, Thus ye schulen blesse the sones of Israel, and ye schulen seie to hem,
The Lord blesse thee, and kepe thee;
the Lord schewe his face to thee, and haue mercy on thee;
the Lord turne his cheer to thee, and yyue pees to thee.
Thei schulen clepe inwardli my name on the sones of Israel, and Y schal blesse hem.
Forsothe it was don in the dai in which Moises fillide the tabernacle, and reiside it, and anoyntide and halewide with alle `hise vessels, the auter in lijk maner and the vessels therof.
And the princes of Israel, and the heedis of meynees that weren bi alle lynagis, `the souereyns of hem that weren noumbrid,
offeriden yiftis bifor the Lord, sixe waynes hylid with twelue oxun; twei duykis offeriden o wayn, and ech offeride oon oxe. And thei offeriden tho waynes `in the siyt of the tabernacle.
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises,
Take thou of hem, that tho serue in the seruice of the tabernacle, and bitake thou tho to dekenes bi the ordre of her seruice.
And so whanne Moises hadde take the waynes, and the oxun, he bitook tho to the dekenes.
He yaf twei waynes and foure oxun to the sones of Gerson, bi that that thei hadden nedeful.
He yaf four other waynes and eiyte oxun to the sones of Merari, bi her offices and religioun, vnder the hond of Ythamar, the sone of Aaron, preest.
Forsothe he yaf not waynes and oxun to the sones of Caath, for thei seruen in the seyntuarye, and beren chargis with her owne schuldris.
Therfor the duykis offeriden, in the halewyng of the auter, in the dai in which it was anoyntid, her offryng to the Lord, bifore the auter.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Alle dukis bi hemsilf offre yiftis, bi alle daies bi hem silf, in to the halewyng of the auter.

And in to sacrifices of pesyble thingis he offride tweyne oxun, fyue rammes, fyue `buckis of geet, fyue lambren of o yeer. This was the offryng of Phegiel, the sone of Ochran.
In the tweluethe dai Ahira, the sone of Enan, the prince of the sones of Neptalym,
offride a siluerne vessel `to preue encense and siche thingis, peisynge an hundrid and thetti siclis, a siluerne viol, hauynge seuenti siclis at the weiyte of seyntuarie, euer eithir ful of flour spreynt to gidere with oile, in to sacrifice;
a goldun morter, peisynge ten siclis, ful of encense;
an oxe of the drooue, and a ram, and a lomb of o yeer, in to brent sacrifice;
and a `buc of geet, for synne.
And in to sacrifices of pesible thingis he offride tweyne oxun, fyue rammes, fyue `buckis of geet, fyue lambren of o yeer. This was the offryng of Haira, the sone of Henan.
These thingis weren offrid of the sones of Israel, in the halewyng of the auter, in the dai in which it was halewid; siluerne vessels `to preue, encense and siche thingis twelue, siluerne viols twelue, goldun morteris twelue;
so that o vessel `to preue encense and siche thingis hadde an hundrid and thretti siclis `of siluer, and o viol hadde seuenti siclis, that is, in comyn, two thousynde and foure hundrid siclis of alle the `vessels of siluer, bi the weiyte of seyntuarie;
goldun morteris twelue, ful of encense, peisynge ten siclis bi the weiyte of seyntuarie, that is to gidere an hundrid and twenti siclis of gold;
oxun of the drooue in to brent sacrifice twelue, twelue rammes, twelue lambren of o yeer, and the fletynge sacryfices `of tho, twelue `buckis of geet for synne;
the sacrifices of pesible thingis, foure and twenti oxun, sexty rammes, sexti `buckis of geet, sixti lambren of o yeer. These thingis weren offrid in the halewyng of the auter, whanne it was anoyntid.
And whanne Moyses entride in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, `to axe counsel `of Goddis answeryng place, he herde the vois of God spekynge to hym fro `the propiciatorie, which was on the arke of witnessyng, bitwixe twei cherubyns, fro whennus also God spak to Moises.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to Aaron,
and thou schalt seie to hym, Whanne thou hast sett seuene launternes, the candilstike be reisid in the south part; therfor comaunde thou this, that the lanternes biholde euene ayens the north to the boord of looues of `settyng forth, tho schulen schyne ayenus that part which the candilstike biholdith.
And Aaron dide, and puttide lanternes on the candilstike, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
Sotheli this was the makyng of the candilstike; it was of gold betun out with hameris, as wel the myddil stok as alle thingis that camen forth of euer eithir side of the yeerdis; bi the saumple `whych the Lord schewide to Moises, so he wrouyte the candilstike.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Take thou Leuytis fro the myddis of the sones of Israel;
and thou schalt clense hem bi this custom. Be thei spreynt with watir of clensyng, and schaue thei alle the heeris of her fleisch. And whanne thei han waische her clothis and ben clensid, take thei an oxe of drooues,
and the fletyng sacrifice therof, flour spreynt to gidere with oile; forsothe thou schalt take another oxe of the drooue for synne;
and thou schalt present the Leuytis bifor the tabernacle of boond of pees, whanne al the multitude of the sones of Israel is clepid togidere.
And whanne the Leuytis ben bifor the Lord, the sones of Israel schulen sette her hondis on hem;
and Aaron schal offre the Leuytis in the siyt of the Lord, a yifte of the sones of Israel, that thei serue in the seruice `of hym.
Also the Leuytis schulen sette her hondis on the heedis of the oxun, of whiche oxun thou schalt make oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice of the Lord, that thou preye for hem.
And thou schalt ordeyne the Leuytis in the siyt of Aaron, and of hise sones, and thou schalt sacre hem offrid to the Lord;
and thou schalt departe hem fro the myddis of the sones of Israel, that thei be myne.
And aftirward entre thei in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, that thei serue me; and so thou schalt clense and schalt halewe hem, in to an offryng of the Lord, for bi fre yifte thei ben youun to me of the sones of Israel.
Y haue take hem for the firste gendrid thingis that openen ech wombe in Israel;
for alle the firste gendrid thingis of the sones of Israel ben myne, as wel of men as of beestis, fro the dai in which Y smoot ech firste gendrid thing in the loond of Egipt, Y halewide hem to me.
And Y took the Leuytis for alle the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel;
and Y yaf hem bi fre yifte to Aaron and hise sones, fro the myddis of the puple, that thei serue me for Israel, in the tabernacle of boond of pees, and that thei preie for hem, lest veniaunce be in the puple, if thei ben hardi to neiye to the seyntuarye.
And Moises and Aaron, and al the multitude of the sones of Israel, diden on the Leuitis tho thingis that the Lord comaundide to Moyses.
And thei weren clensid, and thei waischiden her clothis; and Aaron reiside hem in the siyt of the Lord, and preiede for hem,
that thei schulen be clensid, and schulden entre to her offices in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, bifor Aaron and hise sones; as the Lord comaundide to Moises of the Leuytis, so it was don.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, This is lawe of Leuytis;
fro fyue and twentithe yeer and aboue thei schulen entre, for to mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees;
and whanne thei han fillid the fiftithe yeer of age, thei schulen ceesse to serue.
And thei schulen be the mynystris of her bretheren in the tabernacle of boond of pees, that thei kepe tho thingis that ben bitakun to hem; sothely thei schulen not do tho werkis; thus thou schalt dispose Leuytis in her kepyngis.
And the Lord spak to Moises, in the deseert of Synay, in the secounde yeer aftir that thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt, in the firste moneth,
and seide, The sones of Israel make pask in his tyme,
in the fourtenthe day of this monethe, at the euentid, bi alle the cerymonyes and iustifiyngis therof.
And Moises comaundide to the sones of Israel, that thei schulden make pask;
whiche maden in his tyme, in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, in the hil of Synai; bi alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises, the sones of Israel diden.
Lo! forsothe summen vncleene on the soule of man, that myyten not make pask in that dai, neiyiden to Moises and Aaron,
and seiden to hem, We ben vncleene `on the soule of man; whi ben we defraudid, that we moun not offre an offryng to the Lord in his tyme, among the sones of Israel?
To whiche Moises answeride, Stonde ye, that Y take counseil, what the Lord comaundith of you.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Speke thou to the sones of Israel, A man of youre folk which is vncleene `on the soule, ether in the weie fer, make he pask to the Lord in the secounde monethe,
in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid; with therf looues and letusis of the feeld he schal ete it.
Thei schulen not leeue ony thing therof til the morewtid, and thei schulen not breke a boon therof; thei schulen kepe al the custom of pask.
Forsothe if ony man is bothe cleene, and is not in the weie, and netheles made not pask, thilke man schal be distried fro hise puplis, for he offeride not sacrifice to the Lord in his tyme; he schal bere his synne.
Also if a pilgrym and comelyng is anentis you, make he pask to the Lord, bi the cerymonyes and iustifiyngis therof; the same comaundement schal be anentis you, as wel to a comelyng as to a man borun in the loond.
Therfore in the dai in which the tabernacle was reisid, a cloude hilide it; sotheli as the licnesse of fier was on the tente fro euentid til the morewtid.
Thus it was don continueli, a cloude hilide it bi dai, and as the licnesse of fier bi nyyt.
And whanne the cloude that hilide the tabernacle was takun awei, thanne the sones of Israel yeden forth, and in the place where the cloude stood, there thei settiden tentis.
At the comaundement of the Lord thei yeden forth, and at his comaundement thei settiden the tabernacle. In alle daies in whiche the cloude stood on the tabernacle, thei dwelliden in the same place.
And if it bifelde that it dwellide in myche tyme on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel weren in the watchis of the Lord, and thei yeden not forth,
in hou many euer daies the cloude was on the tabernacle. At the comaundement of the Lord thei reisiden tentis, and at his comaundement thei diden doun.
If the cloude was fro euentid `til to the morewtid, and anoon in the morewtid hadde left, thei yeden forth; and if aftir a dai and nyyt it hadde go awei, thei scateriden, `ether diden doun, tentis.
Whether in two monethis, ether in o monethe, ether in lengere tyme, `the cloude hadde be on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel dwelliden in the same place, and yeden not forth; but anoon as it hadde go awey, thei moueden tentis.
Bi the word of the Lord thei settiden tentis, and bi his word thei wenten forth; and thei weren in the watchis of the Lord, bi his comaundement, bi the hond of Moyses.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Make to thee twei siluerne trumpis betun out with hameris, bi whiche thou maist clepe togidere the multitude, whanne the tentis schulen be moued.
And whanne thou schalt sowne with trumpis, al the cumpeny schal be gaderid to thee at the dore of the tabernacle of the boond of pees.
If thou schalt sowne onys, the princes and the heedis of the multitude of Israel schulen come to thee;
but if a lengere and departid trumpyng schal sowne, thei that ben at the eest coost schulen moue tentis first.
Forsothe in the secounde sown and lijk noise of the trumpe thei that dwellen at the south schulen reise tentis; and bi this maner othere men schulen do, whanne the trumpis schulen sowne in to goyng forth.
Forsothe whanne the puple schal be gederid to gidere, symple cry of trumpis schal be, and tho schulen not sowne departyngli.
The sones of Aaron preest schulen sowne with trumpis, and this schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns.
If ye schulen go out of youre lond to batel ayens enemyes that fiyten ayens you, ye schulen crye with trumpis sownynge, and the bithenkyng of you schal be bifor youre Lord God, that ye be delyuered fro the hondis of youre enemyes.
If ony tyme ye schulen haue a feeste, and halidaies, and calendis, ye schulen synge in trumpis on brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices, that tho be to you in to remembryng of youre God; Y am youre Lord God.
In the secounde yeer, in the secounde monethe, in the twentithe dai of the monethe, the cloude was reisid fro the tabernacle of boond of pees.
And the sones of Israel yeden forth bi her cumpenyes fro deseert of Synay; and the cloude restide in the wildirnesse of Faran.
And the sones of Juda bi her cumpenyes, of whiche the prince was Naason, the sone of Amynadab, moueden first tentis,
bi the Lordis comaundement maad in the hond of Moises.
In the lynage of the sones of Ysacar the prince was Nathanael, the sone of Suar.
In the lynage of Sabulon the prince was Heliab, the sone of Helon.
And the tabernacle was takun doun, which the sones of Gerson and of Merary baren, and `yeden out.
And the sones of Ruben yeden forth bi her cumpenyes and ordre, of whiche the prince was Helisur, the sone of Sedeur.
Forsothe in the lynage of the sones of Symeon the prince was Salamyel, the sone of Surisaddai.
Sotheli in the lynage of Gad the prince was Helisaphath, the sone of Duel.
And the sones of Caath yeden forth, and baren the seyntuarie; so longe the tabernacle was borun, til thei camen to the place of reisyng therof.
Also the sones of Effraym, bi her cumpanyes, moueden tentis, in whos oost the prince was Elisama, the sone of Amyud.
Forsothe in the lynage of the sones of Manasses the prince was Gamaliel, the sone of Phadussur.
And in the lynage of Beniamyn the duk was Abidan, the sone of Gedeon.
The sones of Dan, bi her cumpenyes, yeden forth the laste of alle tentis, in whos oost the prince was Aizer, the sone of Amysaddai.
Sotheli in the lynage of the sones of Aser the prince was Phegiel, the sone of Ochran.
And in the lynage of the sones of Neptalym the prince was Haira, the sone of Henan.
These ben the castels and the goinges forth of the sones of Israel, bi her cumpenyes, whanne thei yeden out.
And Moises seide to Heliab, the sone of Raguel, of Madian, his alie `ethir fadir of his wijf, We goon forth to the place which the Lord schal yyue to vs; come thou with vs, that we do wel to thee, for the Lord bihiyte goode thingis to Israel.
To whom he answeride, Y schal not go with thee, but Y schal turne ayen in to my lond, in which Y was borun.
And Moises seide, Nyle thou forsake vs, for thou knowist in whiche places we owen to sette tentis, and thou schalt be oure ledere;
and whanne thou schalt come with vs, what euer thing schal be the beste of the richessis whiche the Lord schal yyue to vs, we schulen yyue to thee.
And therfor thei yeden forth fro the hil of the Lord the weie of thre daies; and the arke of boond of pees of the Lord yede bifor hem, bi thre daies, and purueyde the place of tentis.
And the cloude of the Lord was on hem bi day, whanne thei yeden.
And whanne the arke was reisid, Moises seide, Ryse thou, Lord, and thin enemyes be scaterid, and thei that haten thee, fle fro thi face;
forsothe whanne the arke was put doun, he seide, Lord, turne ayen to the multitude of the oost of Israel.
Yn the meene tyme the grutchyng of the puple, as of men sorewynge for trauel, roos ayens the Lord. And whanne Moises hadde herd this thing, he was wrooth; and the fier of the Lord was kyndelid on hem, and deuouride the laste part of the tentis.
And whanne the puple hadde cried to Moises, Moises preiede the Lord, and the fier was quenchid.
And he clepid the name of that place Brennyng, for the fier of the Lord was kyndlid ayens hem.
And the comyn puple of `malis and femalis, that hadde stied with hem, brent with desire of fleischis, and sat, and wepte with the sones of Israel ioyned togidere to hem, and seide, Who schal yyue to vs fleischis to ete?
We thenken on the fischis whiche we eten in Egipt freli; gourdis, and melouns, and lekis, and oyniouns, and garlekis comen in to mynde `to vs;
oure soule is drie ; oure iyen byholden noon other thing `no but manna.
Forsothe manna was as the seed of coriaundre, of the colour of bdellyum, which is whijt and briyt as cristal.
And the puple yede aboute, and gaderide it, and brak with a queerne stoon, ether pownede in a morter, and sethide in a pot; and made therof litle cakis of the sauour, as of breed maad with oile.
And whanne dew cam doun in the niyt on the tentis, also manna cam doun togidere.
Therfor Moises herde the puple wepynge bi meynees, and `alle bi hem silf bi the doris of her tentis; and the woodnesse of the Lord was wrooth greetli, but also the thing was seyn vnsuffrable to Moises.
And he seide to the Lord, Whi hast thou turmentid thi seruaunt? whi fynde Y not grace bifor thee? and whi hast thou put on me the burthun of al this puple?
whethir Y conseyuede al this multitude, ethir gendride it, that thou seie to me, Bere thou hem in thi bosum as a nurise is wont to bere a litil yong child, and bere thou in to the lond for which thou hast swore to the fadris `of hem.
wherof ben fleischis to me, that Y `yyue to so greet multitude? Thei wepen bifore me, and seyn, `Yyue thou fleischis to vs that we ete;
I mai not aloone suffre al this puple, for it is greuouse to me.
If in other maner it semeth to thee, Y biseche that thou sle me, and that Y fynde grace in thin iyen, that Y be not punyschid bi so grete yuelis.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Gadere thou to me seuenti men of the eldre men of Israel, whiche thou knowist, `that thei ben the elde men and maistris of the puple; and thou schalt lede hem to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and thou schalt make to stonde there with thee,
that Y come doun, and speke to thee; and Y schal take awey of thi spirit, and Y schal yyue to hem, that thei susteyne with thee the birthun of the puple, and not thou aloone be greuyd.
And thou schalt seie to the puple, Be ye halewid; to morew ye schulen ete fleischis; for Y herde you seie, Who schal yyue to vs the metis of fleischis? it was wel to vs in Egipt; that the Lord yyue `fleischis to you,
and that ye ete not o dai, ethir tweyne, ethir fyue, ethir ten, sotheli nether twenti,
but `til to a monethe of daies, til it go out bi youre nosethirlis, and turne in to wlatyng; for ye han put awei the Lord, which is in the myddis of you, and ye wepten bifor hym, and seiden, Whi yeden we out of Egipt?
And Moises seide to the Lord, Sixe hundrid thousynde of foot men ben of this puple, and thou seist, Y schal yyue to hem `mete of fleischis an hool monethe.
Whether the multitude of scheep and of oxun schal be slayn, that it may suffice to mete, ethir alle the fischis of the see schulen be gaderid to gidere, that tho fille hem?
To whom the Lord answeride, Whether the `hond of the Lord is vnmyyti? riyt now thou schalt se, wher my word schal be fillid in werk.
Therfor Moises cam, and telde to the puple the wordis of the Lord; and he gaderide seuenti men of the eldere of Israel, whiche he made stonde aboute the tabernacle.
And the Lord cam doun bi a cloude, and spak to Moises, and took a weye of the spirit that was in Moises, and yaf to the seuenti men; and whanne the spirit hadde restid in hem, thei profesieden, and ceessiden not `aftirward.
Forsothe twei men dwelliden stille in the tentis, of whiche men oon was clepid Heldad, and the tothir Medad, on whiche the spirit restide; for also thei weren descryued, and thei yeden not out to the tabernacle.
And whanne thei profesieden in the tentis, a child ran, and teld to Moises, and seide, Heldad and Medad profecien in the tentis.
Anoon Josue, the sone of Nun, the `mynystre of Moises, and chosun of manye, seide, My lord Moises, forbede thou hem.
And he seide, What hast thou enuye for me? who yyueth that al the puple profesie, and that God yyue his spirit to hem?
And Moises turnede ayen, and the eldre men in birthe of Israel in to the tentis.
Forsothe a wynde yede forth fro the Lord, and took curlewis, and bar ouer the see, and lefte in to the tentis, in the iurney, as myche as mai be parformed in o day, bi ech part of the tentis bi cumpas; and tho flowen in the eir bi twei cubitis in `hiynesse ouer the erthe.
Therfor the puple roos in al that dai and nyyt and in to the tothir dai, and gaderide the multitude of curlewis; he that gaderide litil, gaderide ten `mesuris clepid chorus; `and o chorus conteyneth ten buschels; and thei drieden tho curlewis bi the cumpas of the tentis.
Yit `fleischis weren in the teeth `of hem, and siche mete failide not; and lo! the woodnesse of the Lord was reisid ayens the puple, and smoot it with a ful greet veniaunce.
And thilke place was clepid The sepulcris of coueitise, for there thei birieden the puple that desiride fleischis.
Sotheli thei yeden `out of the sepulcris of coueitise, and camen in to Asseroth, and dwelliden there.
And Marie spak and Aaron ayens Moises, for his wijf a womman of Ethiope,
and seiden, Whethir God spak oneli by Moises? whethir he spak not also to vs in lijk maner? And whanne the Lord hadde herd this, he was wrooth greetli;
for Moises was the myldest man, ouer alle men that dwelliden in erthe.
And anoon the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron and to Marye, Go out ye thre aloone to the tabernacle of boond of pees. And whanne thei weren gon yn,
the Lord cam doun in a piler of cloude, and he stood in the entryng of the tabernacle, and clepide Aaron and Marie.
And whanne thei hadden go, he seide to hem, Here ye my wordis; if ony among you is a profete of the Lord, Y schal appere to hym in reuelacioun, ethir Y schal speke to hym bi `a dreem.
And he seide, And my seruaunt Moises is not siche, which is moost feithful in al myn hows;
for Y speke to hym mouth to mouth, and he seeth God opynli, and not bi derke spechis and figuris. Why therfor dredden ye not to bacbite `ether depraue my seruaunt Moises?
And the Lord was wrooth ayens hem, and he wente a wei.
And the cloude yede awei, that was on the tabernacle and lo! Marie apperide whijt with lepre as snow. And whanne Aaron biheelde hir, and siy hir bispreynd with lepre,
he seide to Moises, My lord, Y beseche, putte thou not this synne on vs,
which we diden folili, that this womman be not maad as deed, and as a deed borun thing which is cast out of the `wombe of his modir; lo! now the half of hir fleisch is deuourid with lepre.
And Moises criede to the Lord, and seide, Lord, Y biseche, heele thou hir.
To whom the Lord answerid, If hir fadir hadde spet in to hir face, where sche ouyte not to be fillid with schame, nameli in seuene daies? Therfor be sche departid out of the tentis bi seuen daies, and aftirward sche schal be clepid ayen.
And so Marie was excludid out of the tentis bi seuene daies; and the puple was not mouyd fro that place, til Marie was clepid ayen.

And the puple yede forth fro Asseroth, whanne the tentis weren set in the deseert of Pharan.
And there the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Sende thou men that schulen biholde the lond of Canaan, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel, of ech lynage o man of the princes.
Moises dide that that the Lord comaundide, and sente fro the deseert of Pharan princes, men of whiche these ben the names.
Of the lynage of Ruben, Semmya, the sone of Zectur.
Of the lynage of Symeon, Saphat, the sone of Hury.
Of the lynage of Juda, Caleph, the sone of Jephone.
Of the lynage of Isachar, Igal, the sone of Joseph.
Of the lynage of Effraym, Osee, the sone of Nun.
Of the lynage of Beniamyn, Phalti, the sone of Raphu.
Of the lynage of Zabulon, Gediel, the sone of Sodi.
Of the lynage of Joseph, of the gouernaunce of Manasses, Gaddi, the sone of Susy.
Of the lynage of Dan, Amyel, the sone of Gemalli.
Of the lynage of Aser, Sur, the sone of Mychael.
Of the lynage of Neptalym, Nabdi, the sone of Napsi.
Of the lynage of Gad, Guel, the sone of Machi.
These ben the names of men, which Moises sente to biholde the lond of Canaan; and he clepide Osee, the sone of Nun, Josue.
Therfor Moises sente hem to biholde the lond of Canaan, and seide to hem, `Stie ye bi the south coost; and whanne ye comen to the hillis,
biholde ye the lond, what maner lond it is; and biholde ye the puple which is the dwellere therof, whether it is strong, ethir feble, `whether thei ben fewe in noumbre, ether manye;
whether that lond is good, ethir yuel; what maner citees ben, wallid, ether without wallis;
whether the lond is fat, ether bareyn, `whether it is ful of woodis, ethir without trees. Be ye coumfortid, and `brynge ye to vs of the fruytis of that lond. Sotheli the tyme was, whanne grapis first ripe myyten be etun thanne.
And whanne thei hadden stied, thei aspieden the lond, fro the deseert of Syn `til to Rohob, as men entryth to Emath.
And thei stieden to the south, and camen in to Ebron, where Achyman, and Sisai, and Tholmai, the sones of Enach, weren; for Hebron was maad bi seuen yeer bifor Thamnys, the citee of Egipt.
And thei yeden til to the stronde of clustre, and kittiden doun a sioun with his grape, which twei men baren in a barre; also thei token of pumgarnadis, and of the figis of that place which is clepid Nehelescol,
that is, the stronde of grape, for the sones of Israel baren a clustre fro thennus.
And the aspieris of the lond, whanne thei hadden cumpassid al the cuntrey, after fourti daies camen to Moises and Aaron,
and to al the cumpany of the sones of Israel, in to the deseert of Pharan which is in Cades. And `the aspieris spaken to hem, and schewiden the fruytis of the lond to al the multitude, and telden,
and seiden, We camen to the lond, to which thou sentest vs, which lond treuli flowith with mylk and hony, as it may be knowun bi these fruytis;
but it hath strongeste inhabiteris, and grete cytees, and wallid; we sien there the kynrede of Anachym; Amalech dwellith in the south;
Ethei, and Jebusei, and Amorey dwellen in the hilli placis; forsothe Cananey dwellith bisidis the see, and bisidis the floodis of Jordan.
Among thes thingis Caleph peeside the grutchyng of the puple, that was maad ayens Moises, and seide, `Stie we, and welde we the lond, for we moun gete it.
Forsothe other aspieris, that weren with hym, seiden, We moun not stie to this puple, for it is strongere than we.
And thei deprauyden the lond which thei hadden biholde, anentis the sones of Israel, and seiden, The lond which we cumpassiden deuourith hise dwelleris; the puple which we bihelden is of large stature; there we syen summe wondris ayens kynde, of the sones of Enach, of the kynde of geauntis, to whiche we weren comparisound, and weren seien as locustis.
Therfor al the cumpeny criede, and wepte in that nyyt,
and alle the sones of Israel grutchiden ayens Moises and Aaron, and seiden,
We wolden that we hadden be deed in Egipt, and not in this waast wildirnesse ; we wolden that we perischen, and that the Lord lede vs not in to this lond, lest we fallen bi swerd, and oure wyues and fre children ben led prisoneris; whether it is not betere to turne ayen in to Egipt?
And thei seiden oon to another, Ordeyne we a duyk to vs, and turne we ayen in to Egipt.
And whanne this was herd, Moises and Aaron felden lowe to erthe, bifor al the multitude of the sones of Israel.
And sotheli Josue, the sone of Nun, and Caleph, the sone of Jephone, whiche also cumpassiden the lond, to renten her clothis,
and spaken to al the multitude of the sones of Israel, The lond which we cumpassiden is ful good;
if the Lord is merciful to vs, he schal lede vs in to it, and schal yyue `to vs the lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
Nyle ye be rebel ayens the Lord, nether drede ye the puple of this lond, for we moun deuoure hem so as breed; al her help passide awei fro hem, the Lord is with vs, nyle ye drede.
And whanne al the multitude criede, and wolde oppresse hem with stonys, the glorie of the Lord apperide on the roof of the boond of pees, while alle the sones of Israel sien.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Hou long schal this puple bacbite me? Hou longe schulen thei not bileue to me in alle `signes, whiche Y haue do bifor hem?
Therfor Y schal smyte hem with pestilence, and Y schal waste hem; forsothe Y schal make thee prince on a greet folk, and strongere than is this.
And Moises seide to the Lord, Egipcians `here not, fro whos myddil thou leddist out this puple,
and the dwelleris of this loond, whiche herden that thou, Lord, art in this puple, and art seyn face to face, and that thi cloude defendith hem, and that thou goist bifore hem in a pilere of cloude bi dai,
and in a piler of fier bi nyyt, that thou hast slayn so greet a multitude as o man,
and seie thei, He myyte not brynge this puple in to the lond for whiche he swoor, therfor he killide hem in wildirnesse;
therfor the strengthe of the Lord be magnified, as thou hast swore. And Moises seide,
Lord pacient, and of myche mercy, doynge awei wickidnesse and trespassis, and leeuynge no man vngilti, which visitist the synnes of fadris in to sones in to the thridde and fourthe generacioun, Y biseche,
foryyue thou the synne of this thi puple, aftir the greetnesse of thi merci, as thou were merciful to men goynge out of Egipt `til to this place.
And the Lord seide, Y haue foryouun to hem, bi thi word.
Y lyue; and the glorie of the Lord schal be fillid in al erthe;
netheles alle men that sien my mageste, and my signes, whiche Y dide in Egipt and in the wildirnesse, and temptiden me now bi ten sithis, and obeieden not to my vois,
schulen not se the lond for which Y swore to her fadris, nethir ony of hem that bacbitide me, schal se it.
Y schal lede my seruaunt Caleph, that was ful of anothir spirit, and suede me, in to this lond, which he cumpasside, and his seed schal welde it.
For Amalech and Cananei dwellen in the valeis, to morewe moue ye tentis, and turne ye ayen in to wildirnesse bi the weie of the reed see.
And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron, and seide,
Hou long grutchith this werste multitude ayens me? Y haue herd the pleyntis of the sones of Israel.
Therfor seie thou to hem, Y lyue, seith the Lord; as ye spaken while Y herde, so Y schal do to you;
youre careyns schulen ligge in this wildirnesse. Alle ye that ben noumbrid, fro twenti yeer and aboue, and grutchiden ayens me,
schulen not entre in to the lond, on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde make you to dwelle outakun Caleph, the sone of Jephone, and Josue, the sone of Nun.
Forsothe Y schal lede in youre litle children, of whiche ye seiden that thei schulden be preyes `ethir raueyns to enemyes, that thei se the lond which displeside you.
Forsothe youre careyns schulen ligge in the wildirnesse;
youre sones schulen be walkeris aboute in the deseert bi fourti yeer, and thei schulen bere youre fornycacioun, til the careyns of the fadris ben wastid in the deseert,
by the noumbre of fourti daies, in whiche ye bihelden the loond; a yeer schal be arettid for a dai, and bi fourti yeer ye schulen resseyue youre wickidnesse, and ye schulen knowe my veniaunce.
For as Y spak, so Y schal do to al this werste multitude, that roos to gidere ayens me; it schal faile, and schal die in this wildirnesse.
Therfor alle the men whyche Moises hadde sent to see the lond, and whiche turniden ayen, and maden al the multitude to grutche ayens hym, and depraueden the lond, that it was yuel,
weren deed, and smytun in the siyt of the Lord.
Sotheli Josue, the sone of Nun, and Caleph, the sone of Jephone, lyueden, of alle men that yeden to se the lond.
And Moises spak alle these wordis to alle the sones of Israel, and the puple mourenyde gretli.
And, lo! thei riseden in the morewtid first, and `stieden in to the cop of the hil, and seiden, We ben redi to stie to the place, of which the Lord spak, for we synneden.
To whiche Moises seide, Whi passen ye the word of the Lord, that schal not bifalle to you in to prosperite?
Nyle ye stie, for the Lord is not with you, lest ye fallen bifor youre enemyes.
Amalech and Cananei ben bifor you, bi the swerd of whiche ye schulen falle, for ye nolden assente to the Lord, nether the Lord schal be with you.
And thei weren maad derk, and stieden in to the cop of the hil; forsothe the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moises yeden not awey fro the tentis.
And Amalech cam doun, and Chananei, that dwelliden in the hil, and he smoot hem, and kittide doun, and pursuede hem til Horma.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of youre abitacioun which Y schal yyue to you,
and ye make an offryng to the Lord in to brent sacrifice, ether a pesible sacrifice, and ye payen auowis, ethir offren yiftis bi fre wille, ethir in youre solempnytees ye brennen odour of swetnesse to the Lord, of oxun, ether of scheep;
who euer offrith the slayn sacrifice, schal offre a sacrifice of flour, the tenthe part of ephi, spreynt togidere with oile, which oil schal haue a mesure the fourthe part of hyn;
and he schal yyue wyn to fletynge sacrifices to be sched, of the same mesure, in to brent sacrifice, and slayn sacrifice.
Bi ech loomb and ram schal be the sacrifice of flour, of twey tenthe partis, which schal be spreynt togidere with oile, of the thridde part of hyn;
and he schal offre wyn to the fletynge sacrifice, of the thridde part of the same mesure, in to odour of swetnesse to the Lord.
Forsothe whanne thou makist a brent sacrifice, ethir an offryng of oxun, that thou fille avow, ethir pesible sacrifice, thou schalt yyue,
bi ech oxe, thre tenthe partis of flour, spreynt togidere with oile, which schal haue the half of mesure of hyn;
and thou schalt yyue wyn to fletynge sacrifices to be sched, of the same mesure, in to offryng of the swettest odour to the Lord.
So ye schulen do bi ech oxe, and ram,
and lomb, and kide;
as wel men borun in the lond,
as pilgrymys, schulen offre sacrifices bi the same custom;
o comaundement and doom schal be, as wel to you as to comelyngis of the lond.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem,
Whanne ye comen in to the lond which Y schal yyue to you,
and `ye eten of the looues of that cuntrey, ye
schulen departe the firste fruytis of youre metis to the Lord; as ye schulen departe the firste fruytis of corn flooris,
so ye schulen yyue the firste fruytis also of sewis to the Lord.
That if bi ignoraunce ye passen ony of tho thingis whiche the Lord spak to Moyses,
and comaundide bi hym to you, fro the dai in which he bigan to comaunde,
and ouer, and the multitude hath foryete to do, it schal offre a calf of the drooue, brent sacrifice in to swettist odour to the Lord, and the sacrificis therof, and fletynge offryngis, as the cerymonyes therof axen; and it schal offre a `buc of geet for synne.
And the preest schal preie for al the multitude of the sones of Israel, and it schal be foryouun to hem, for thei synneden not wilfuli. And neuerthelesse thei schulen offre encense to the Lord for hemsilf, and for her synne and errour;
and it schal be foryouun to al the puple of the sones of Israel, and to comelyngis that ben pilgryms among hem, for it is the synne of al the multitude bi ignoraunce.
That if a soule synneth vnwityngli, it schal offre a geet of o yeer for his synne; and the preest schal preye for that soule, for it synnede vnwityngli bifor the Lord;
and the preest schal gete foryyuenesse to it, and synne schal be foryouun to it.
As wel to men borun in the lond as to comelyngis, o lawe schal be of alle that synnen vnwityngli.
Forsothe a man that doith ony synne bi pride, schal perische fro his puple, whether he be a citeseyn, ethir a pilgrym, for he was rebel ayens the Lord;
for he dispiside the word of the Lord, and made voide his comaundement; therfor he schal be doon awei, and schal bere his owne wickidnes.
Forsothe it was doon, whanne the sones of Israel weren in wildirnesse, and hadde founde a man gaderynge woode in the `day of sabat,
thei brouyten hym to Moises, and to Aaron, and to al the multitude; whiche closiden hym in to prisoun,
and wisten not what thei schulden do of hym.
And the Lord seide to Moises, This man die bi deeth; al the cumpeny oppresse hym with stoonus with out the tentis.
And whanne thei hadden led hym with out forth, thei oppressiden him with stoonus, and he was deed, as the Lord comaundide.
Also the Lord seide to Moises,
Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seye to hem, that thei make to hem hemmes bi foure corneris of mentils, and sette laces of iacynct `in tho;
and whanne thei seen thoo, haue thei mynde of alle comaundementis of the Lord, lest thei suen her thouytis and iyen, doynge fornycacioun bi dyuerse thingis;
but more be thei myndeful of the `Lordis heestis, and do thei tho, and be thei hooli to her God.
Y am youre Lord God, which ledde you out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde be youre God.
Lo! forsothe Chore, the sone of Isuar, sone of Caath, sone of Leuy, and Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab, and Hon, the sone of Pheleph, of the sones of Ruben, rysen ayens Moises,
and othere of the sones of Israel, two hundryd men and fifti, prynces of the synagoge, and whiche weren clepid bi names in the tyme of counsel.
And whanne `thei hadden stonde ayens Moises and Aaron, thei seiden, Suffice it to you, for al the multitude is of hooly men, and the Lord is in hem; whi ben ye reisid on the puple of the Lord?
And whanne Moises hadde herd this, he felde lowe on the face.
And he spak to Chore, and to al the multitude; he seide, Eerli the Lord schal make knowun whiche perteynen to hym, and he schal applie to hym hooli men; and thei whiche he hath chose, schulen neiye to hym.
Therfor do ye this thing; ech man take his cencere, thou Chore, and al thi counsel;
and to morewe whanne fier is takun vp, putte ye encense aboue bifor the Lord, and whom euer the Lord chesith, he schal be hooli. Ye sones of Leuy ben myche reisid.
And eft Moises seide to Chore, Ye sones of Leuy, here.
Whether it is litil to you, that God of Israel departide you fro al the puple, and ioynede you to hym silf, that ye schulden serue hym in the seruyce of tabernacle, and that ye schulden stonde bifor the multitude of puple, and schulden serue hym?
Made he therfor thee and alle thi bretheren the sones of Leuy to neiy to hym silf, that ye chalenge to you also preesthod,
and al thi gaderyng togidere stonde ayens the Lord? For whi what is Aaron, that ye grutchen ayens hym?
Therfor Moises sente to clepe Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab; whiche answeriden, We comen not.
Whethir is it litil to thee, that thou leddist vs out of the lond that flowide with mylk and hony, to sle vs in the deseert, no but also thou be lord of vs?
Verili thou hast bronyt vs in to the lond that flowith with streemys of mylk and hony, and hast youe to vs possessioun of feeldis, and of vyneris; whethir also thou wolt putte out oure iyen?
We comen not. And Moises was wrooth greetli, and seide to the Lord, Biholde thou not the sacrifices of hem; thou wost that Y took neuere of hem, yhe, a litil asse, nethir Y turmentide ony of hem.
And Moises seide to Chore, Thou and al thi congregacioun stonde asidis half bifor the Lord, and Aaron to morewe bi hym silf.
Take ye alle bi you silf youre censeris, and putte ye encense in tho, and offre ye to the Lord, tweyn hundrid and fifti censeris; and Aaron holde his censer.
And whanne thei hadden do this, while Moises and Aaron stoden,
and thei hadden gaderid al the multitude to the `dore of the tabernacle ayens hem, the glorie of the Lord apperide to alle.
And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron,
and seide, Be ye departid fro the myddis of this congregacioun, that Y leese hem sodeynli.
Whiche felden lowe on the face, and seiden, Strongeste God of the spiritis of al fleisch, whethir `thin yre schal be fers ayens alle men, for o man synneth?
And the Lord seide to Moises,
Comaunde thou to al the puple, that it be departid fro the tabernaclis of Chore, and of Dathan, and of Abiron.
And Moises roos, and yede to Dathan and Abiron; and while the eldre men of Israel sueden hym,
he seide to the cumpeny, Go ye awey fro the tabernaclis of wickid men, and nyle ye touche tho thingis that parteynen to hem, lest ye ben wlappid in the synnes of hem.
And whanne thei hadden gon awei fro the tentis `of hem bi the cumpas, Dathan and Abiron yeden out, and stoden in the entryng of her tentis, with wyues, and fre children, and al the multitude.
And Moises seide, In this ye schulen wite that the Lord sente me, that Y schulde do alle thingis whiche ye seen, and Y brouyte not forth tho of myn owne herte.
If thei perischen bi customable deeth of men, and wounde visite hem, bi which also othere men ben wont to be visitid,
the Lord sente not me; but if the Lord doith a newe thing, that the erthe opene his mouth, and swolewe hem, and alle thingis that perteynen to hem, and thei goen doun quyke in to helle, ye schulen wite that thei blasfemeden the Lord.
Therfor anoon as he cesside to speke, the erthe was brokun vndur her feet,
and the erthe openyde his mouth, and deuowride hem, with her tabernaclis, and al the catel `of hem;
and thei yeden doun quike in to helle, and weren hilid with erthe, and perischiden fro the myddis of the multitude.
And sotheli al Israel that stood bi the cumpas, fledde fro the cry of men perischinge, and seide, Lest perauenture the erthe swolewe also vs.
But also fier yede out fro the Lord, and killide tweyn hundrid and fifti men that offriden encense.
And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
Comaunde thou to Eleasar, sone of Aaron, preest, that he take the censeris that liggen in the brennyng, and that he schatere the fier hidur and thidur; for tho ben halewid in the dethis of synneris;
and that he bringe forth tho in to platis, and naile to the auter, for encense is offrid in tho to the Lord, and tho ben halewid, that the sonis of Israel se tho for a signe and memorial.
Therfor Eleazar, preest, took the brasun senseris, in whiche censeris thei whiche the brennyng deuouride hadden offrid, and he `brouyt forth tho in to platis, and nailide to the auter;
that the sones of Israel schulden haue thingis aftirward, bi whiche thei schulden remembre, lest ony alien, and which is not of the seed of Aaron, neiy to offre encense to the Lord, lest he suffre, as Chore sufferide, and al his multitude, while the Lord spak to Moises.
Forsothe al the multitude of the sones of Israel grutchide in the dai suynge ayens Moises and Aaron, and seide, Ye han slayn the puple of the Lord.
And whanne discensioun roos,
and noise encresside, Moises and Aaron fledden to the tabernacle of the boond of pees; and aftir that thei entriden in to it, a cloude hilide the tabernacle, and the glorie of the Lord apperide.
And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron,
Go ye awey fro the myddis of this multitude, also now Y schal do awey hem. And whanne thei laien in the erthe, Moises seide to Aaron,
Take the censer, and whanne fyer is takun vp of the auter, caste encense aboue, and go soone to the puple, that thou preye for hem; for now ire is gon out fro the Lord, and the wounde is feers.
And whanne Aaron hadde do this, and hadde runne to the myddis of the multitude, which the brennynge wastid thanne, he offeride encense;
and he stood bytwixe the deed men and lyuynge, and bisouyte for the puple, and the wounde ceesside.
Sotheli thei that weren smytun weren fourtene thousynde of men and seuene hundrid, with outen hem that perischiden in the discencioun of Chore.
And Aaron turnyde ayen to Moyses, to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, aftir that the perischyng restide.
And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
and take thou yerdis, bi her kynredis, bi ech kynrede o yeerde, take thou of alle the princes of the lynagis twelue yerdis; and thou schalt write the name of each lynage aboue his yerde;
forsothe the name of Aaron schal be in the lynage of Leuy, and o yerde schal conteyne alle the meynees of hem.
And thou schalt putte tho yerdis in the tabernacle of boond of pees, bifor the witnessyng, where Y schal speke to thee; the yerde of hym schal buriowne, whom Y schal chese of hem;
and Y schal refreyne fro me the playnyngis of the sones of Israel, bi whiche thei grutchen ayens you.
And Moyses spak to the sones of Israel; and alle princes yauen to hym yerdis, bi alle lynagis; and the yerdis weren twelue, without the yerde of Aaron.
And whanne Moises hadde put tho yerdis bifor the Lord, in the tabernacle of witnessyng, he yede ayen in the day suynge,
and founde that the yerde of Aaron, `in the hows of Leuy, buriounnede; and whanne knoppis weren greet, the blossoms `hadden broke out, whiche weren alargid in leeuys, and weren fourmed in to alemaundis.
Therfor Moyses brouyte forth alle the yerdis fro the siyt of the Lord to al the sones of Israel; and thei sien, and resseyueden ech his yerde.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Bere ayen the yerde of Aaron in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, that it be kept there in to `the signe of the rebel sones of Israel, and that her `playntis reste fro me, lest thei dien.
And Moises dide, as the Lord comaundide.
Forsothe the sones of Israel seiden to Moises, Lo! we ben wastid, alle we perischiden;
who euer neiyeth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth; whethir we schulen be doon awei alle `til to deeth?
And the Lord seide to Aaron, Thou, and thi sones, and the hows of thi fadir with thee, schulen bere the wickidnesse of the seyntuarie; and thou and thi sones togidere schulen suffre the synnes of youre preesthod.
But also take thou with thee thi britheren of the lynage of Leuy, and the power of thi fadir, and be thei redi, that thei mynystre to thee. Forsothe thou and thi sones schulen mynystre in the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and the dekenes schulen wake at thi comaundementis, and at alle werkis of the tabernacle; so oneli that thei neiye not to the vessels of seyntuarie, and to the autir, lest bothe thei dien, and ye perischen togidere.
Forsothe be thei with thee, and wake thei in the kepyngis of the tabernacle, and in alle the cerymonyes therof. An alien schal not be meddlid with you.
Wake ye in the kepyng of the seyntuarie, and in the seruyce of the auter, lest indignacioun rise on the sones of Israel.
Lo! Y haue youun `to you youre britheren, dekenes, fro the myddis of the sones of Israel, and Y haue youe a fre yifte to the Lord, that thei serue in the seruyces of his tabernacle.
Forsothe thou and thi sones, kepe youre preesthod; and alle thingis that perteynen to the ournyng of the auter, and ben with ynne the veil, schulen be mynystrid bi preestis; if ony straunger neiyeth, he schal be slayn.
The Lord spak to Aaron, Lo! Y haue youe to thee the kepyng of my firste fruytis; Y haue youe to thee and to thi sones alle thingis, that ben halewid of the sones of Israel, for preestis office euerlastynge lawful thingis.
Therfor thou schalt take these thingis of tho thingis that ben halewid, and ben offrid to the Lord; ech offryng, and sacrifice, and what euer thing is yoldun to me for synne and for trespas, and cometh in to hooli of hooli thingis, schal be thin and thi sones.
Thou schalt ete it in the seyntuarie; malis oneli schulen ete therof, for it is halewid to the Lord.
Forsothe Y haue youe to thee, and to thi sones and douytris, bi euerlastynge riyt, the firste fruytis whiche the sones of Israel a vowen and offren; he that is clene in thin hous, schal ete tho.
Y yaf to thee al the merowe of oile, and of wyn, and of wheete, what euer thing of the firste fruytis thei schulen offre to the Lord.
Alle the bigynnyngis of fruytis whiche the erthe bryngith forth, and ben brouyt to the Lord, schulen falle in to thin vsis; he that is cleene in thin hous, schal ete of tho.
Al thing which the sones of Israel yelden bi avow, schal be thin.
What euer thing `schal breke out first of the wombe of al fleisch, which fleisch thei offren to the Lord, whether it is of men, ethir of beestis, it schal be of thi riyt; so oneli that thou take prijs for the firste gendrid child of man, and that thou make ech beeste which is vncleene to be bouyt ayen;
whos ayenbiyng schal be aftir o monethe, for fyue siclis of siluer, bi the weiyte of seyntuarie; a sicle hath xx. halpens.
Forsothe thou schalt not make the firste gendrid of oxe, and of scheep, and of goet, to be ayen bouyt, for tho ben halewid to the Lord; oneli thou schalt schede the blood of tho on the auter, and thou schalt brenne the ynnere fatnesse in to swettist odour to the Lord.
Forsothe the fleischis schulen falle in to thin vss, as the brest halewid and the riyt schuldur, schulen be thine.
Y yaf to the and to thi sones and douytris, bi euerlastynge riyt, alle the firste fruytis of seyntuarie, whiche the sones of Israel offren to the Lord; it is euerlastynge couenant of salt bifor the Lord, to thee, and to thi sones.
And the Lord seide to Aaron, Ye schulen not welde ony thing in the lond of hem, nether ye schulen haue part among hem; Y am thi part and erytage, in the myddis of the sones of Israel.
Forsothe Y yaf to the sones of Leuy alle the tithis of Israel in to possessioun, for the seruyce bi whyche thei seruen me in the tabernacle of boond of pees;
that the sones of Israel neiye no more to the `tabernacle of boond of pees, nether do dedli synne.
To the sones aloone of Leuy, seruynge me in the tabernacle, and berynge the `synnes of the puple, it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns.
Thei schulen welde noon other thing, and thei schulen be apeied with the offryng of tithis, whiche Y departide in to vsis and necessaries of hem.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
Comaunde thou, and denounse to the dekenes, Whanne ye han take tithis of the sones of Israel, whiche Y yaf to you, offre ye the firste fruytis of tho to the Lord, that is, the tenthe part of the dyme,
that it be arettid to you in to offryng of the firste fruytis, as wel of corn flooris as of pressis;
and of alle thingis of whiche ye taken tithis, offre ye the firste fruytis to the Lord, and yyue ye to Aaron, preest.
Alle thingis whiche ye schulen offre of tithis, and schulen departe in to the yiftis of the Lord, schulen be the beste, and alle chosun thingis.
And thou schalt seye to hem, If ye offren to the Lord alle the clere and betere thingis of tithis, it schal be arettid to you, as if ye yauen the firste fruitis of the corn floor and presse.
And ye schulen ete tho tithis in alle youre placis, as wel ye as youre meynees, for it is the prijs for the seruyce, in whiche ye seruen in the tabernacle of witnessyng.
And ye schulen not do synne on this thing, `and resserue noble thingis and fat to you, lest ye defoulen the offryngis of the sones of Israel, and ye dien.
And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron,
and seide, This is the religioun of sacrifice, which the Lord ordeynede. Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, that thei brynge to thee a reed cow of hool age, in which is no wem, nether sche hath bore yok.
And ye schulen bitake hir to Eleazar, preest, which schal offre `the cow, led out of the tentis, in the siyt of alle men.
And he schal dippe his fyngur in the blood therof, and schal sprynge seuene sithis ayens the yatis of the tabernacle.
And he schal brenne that cow, while alle men sien; and he schal yyue as wel the skyn and fleischis therof as the blood and dung to flawme.
Also the preest schal `sende a tre of cedre, and ysope, and reed threed died twies, into the flawme that deuourith the cow.
And thanne at the laste, whanne hise clothis `and bodi ben waischun, he schal entre in to the tentis, and he schal be defoulid `til to euentid.
But also he that brente the cow, schal waische hise clothis, and bodi, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
Forsothe a cleene man schal gadere the aischis of the cow, and schal schede out tho with out the tentis, in a place moost cleene, that tho be to the multitude of the sones of Israel in to keping, and in to watir of spryngyng; for the cow is brent for synne.
And whanne he that bar the aischis of the cow, hath waische hise clothis, he schal be vncleene `til to euentid. And the sones of Israel, and comelyngis that dwellen among hem, schulen haue this hooli bi euerlastynge lawe.
He that touchith a deed bodi of man, and is vncleene for this bi seuene daies,
schal be spreynt of this watir in the thridde, and in the seuenthe dai; and so he schal be clensid. If he is not spreynt in the thridde dai, he schal not mow be clensid in the seuenthe dai.
Ech that touchith the deed bodi bi it silf of mannus soule, and is not spreynt with this medlyng, defoulith the `tabernacle of the Lord, and he schal perische fro Israel; for he is not spreynt with the wateris of clensyng, he schal be vncleene, and his filthe schal dwelle on hym.
This is the lawe of a man that dieth in the tabernacle; alle that entren in to his tente, and alle vessels that ben there, schulen be defoulid bi seuene daies.
A vessel that hath not an hilyng, nethir a byndyng aboue, schal be vncleene.
If ony man touchith the deed bodi of man slayn in the feeld, ether deed bi hym silf, ether a boon, ether the sepulcre `of hym, he schal be vncleene bi seuene daies.
And thei schulen take `of the aischis of the brennyng, and of the synne, and thei schulen sende quyk watris in to a vessel on tho aischis;
in whiche whanne `a cleene man hath dippid ysope, he schal spreynge therof the tente, and al the purtenaunce of howshold, and men defoulid bi sich defoulyng.
And in this maner a cleene man schal clense an vncleene, in the thridde and in the seuenthe dai; and he schal be clensid in the seuenthe dai. And he schal waische hym silf, and hise clothis, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
If ony man is not clensid bi this custom, the soule of hym schal perische fro the myddis of the chirche; for he defoulith the `seyntuarie of the Lord, and is not spreynt with the watir of clensyng.
This comaundement schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge. Also he that schal sprenge the watris schal waische his clothis; ech man that touchith the watris of clensyng, schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
What euer thing an vncleene man touchith, he schal make it vncleene; and a soule that touchith ony of these thingis `defoulid so, schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
And the sones of Israel and al the multitude camen in to the deseert of Syn, in the firste monethe. And the puple dwellide in Cades; and Marie was deed there, and biried in the same place.
And whanne the puple hadde nede to watir, thei yeden togidere ayens Moises and Aaron; and thei weren turned in to dissensioun,
and seiden, We wolden that we hadden perischid among oure britheren bifor the Lord.
Whi han ye led out the chirche of the Lord in to wildirnesse, that bothe we and oure beestis die?
Whi han ye maad vs to stie from Egipt, and han brouyt vs in to this werste place, which may not be sowun, which nether bryngith forth fige tre, nether vineris, nether pumgranatis, ferthermore and hath not watir to drynke?
And whanne the multitude was left, Moises and Aaron entriden in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, and felden lowe to erthe, and crieden to God, and seiden, Lord God, here the cry of this puple, and opene to hem thi tresour, a welle of quyk watir, that whanne thei ben fillid, the grutchyng of hem ceesse. And the glorie of the Lord apperide on hem;
and the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Take the yerde, and gadere the puple, thou, and Aaron thi brother; and speke ye to the stoon bifore hem, and it schal yyue watris. And whanne thou hast led watir out of the stoon, al the multitude schal drynke, and the beestis therof `schulden drynke.
Therfor Moises took the yerde that was in the `siyt of the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym,
whanne the multitude was gaderid bifor the stoon; and he seide to hem, Here ye, rebel and vnbileueful; whether we moun brynge out of this stoon watir to you?
And whanne Moises hadde reisid the hond, and hadde smyte the flynt twies with the yerde, largeste watris yeden out, so that the puple drank, and the beestis drunken.
And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron, For ye bileueden not to me, that ye schulden halewe me bifor the sones of Israel, ye schulen not lede these puples in to the lond which Y schal yyue to hem.
This is the watir of ayenseiyng; there the sones of Israel stryueden ayens the Lord, and he was halewid in hem.
In the meene tyme Moises sente messangeres fro Cades to the kyng of Edom, whiche seiden, Israel thi brother sendith these thinges. Thou knowist al the trauel that took vs,
hou oure fadris yeden doun in to Egipt, and we dwelliden there myche tyme, and Egipcians turmentiden vs and oure fadris; and hou we crieden to the Lord,
and he herde vs, and sente an aungel that ledde vs out of Egipt. And lo! we ben set in the citee of Cades, which is in thi laste coostis,
and we bisechen that it be leueful to vs to passe thorou thi lond; we schulen not go bi feeldis, nether bi vyneris, nether we schulen drynke watris of thi pittis; but we schulen go in the comyn weie, and we schulen not bowe to the riyt side, nether to the left side, til we passen thi termes.
To whom Edom answeride, Ye schulen not passe bi me, ellis Y schal be armed, and come ayens thee.
And the sones of Israel seiden, We schulen go bi the weie comynli vsid, and if we and oure beestis drynken thi watris, we schulen yyue that that is iust; noon hardnesse schal be in prijs, onely passe we swiftli.
And he answeride, Ye schulen not passe. And anoon he yede out ayens Israel, with a multitude without noumbre, and `strong hond,
nether he wolde assente to Israel bisechynge, that he schulde graunte passage bi hise coostis. Wherfor Israel turnede awey fro hym.
And whanne thei hadden moued tentis fro Cades, thei camen in to the hil of Hor, which is in the endis of the lond of Edom;
where the Lord spak to Moyses and seide, Aaron go to his puples;
for he schal not entre in to the lond which Y yaf to the sones of Israel, for he was vnbileueful to my mouth, at the watris of ayenseiyng.
Take thou Aaron, and his sone with hym, and thou schalt lede hem in to the hil of Hor;
and whanne thou hast maad nakid the fadir of his cloth, thou schalt clothe `with it Eleazar, his sone, and Aaron schal be gederid, and schal die there.
Moises dide as the Lord comaundide; and thei stieden in to the hil of Hor, bifor al the multitude.
And whanne he hadde maad nakid Aaron of hise clothis, he clothide with tho Eleazar, his sone.
Sotheli whanne Aaron was deed in the `cop of the hil, Moises cam doun with Eleazar. Sotheli al the multitude siy that Aaron was deed, and wepte on hym thretti daies, bi alle her meyness.
And whanne Chananei, the kyng of Arad, that dwellide at the south, hadde herd this, that is, that Israel cam bi the weye of aspieris, he fauyt ayens hem; and Chananei was ouercomere and ledde pray of Israel.
And Israel bounde hym sylf bi avow to the Lord, and seide, If thou schalt bitake this puple in myn hond, Y schal do awei `the citees therof.
And the Lord herde the preieris of Israel, and bitook the Chananey; and Israel killid hym, and distruyede hise citees; and clepide the name of that place Horma, that is, cursyng, `ethir hangyng up.
`Forsothe thei yeden forth also fro the hil of Hor, bi the weie that ledith to the reed see, that thei schulden cumpasse the lond of Edom; and it bigan to anoye the puple, of the weie and trauel.
And the puple spak ayens the Lord and Moises, and seide, Whi leddist thou vs out of Egipt, that we schulden die in wildirnesse? breed failith, watris ben not; oure soule wlatith now on this `meete moost liyt.
Wherfor the Lord sente `firid serpentis in to the puple; at the woundis of whiche serpentis, and the dethis of ful many men,
thei camen to Moyses, and seiden, We synneden, for we spaken ayens the Lord and thee; preie thou, that he take awey fro vs the serpentis.
And Moises preiede for the puple; and the Lord seide to hym, Make thou a serpent of bras, and sette thou it for a signe ; he that is smytun and biholdith it, schal lyue.
Therfor Moyses made a serpent of bras, and settide for a signe; and men smytun and biholdynge it, weren heelid.
And the sones of Israel yeden forth,
and settiden tentis in Oboth; fro whennus thei yeden forth, and settiden tentis in Neabarym, in the wildirnesse, that biholdith Moab, ayens the eest coost.
And thei moueden fro thennus, and camen to the stronde of Zareth;
which thei leften, and settiden tentis ayens Arnon, which is in the deseert, and apperith in the coostis of Amorrei. Forsothe Arnon is the terme of Moab, and departith Moabitis and Ammoreis.
Wherfor it is seid in the book of batels of the Lord, As he dide in the reed see, so he schal do in the strondis of Arnon;
the harde rochis of the strondis weren bowid, that tho schulen reste in Arnon, and schulden ligge in the coostis of Moabitis.
Fro that place the pit apperide, of which the Lord spak to Moyses, Gadere thou the puple, and Y schal yyue watir to it.
Thanne Israel soong this song, The pit stie;
thei sungen togidere, The pit which the princes diggiden, and the duykis of the multitude maden redi, in the yyuere of the lawe, and in her stauys. And thei yeden forth fro the wildirnesse to Mathana,
fro Mathana to Naaliel, fro Naaliel in to Bamoth;
Bamoth is a valey in the cuntrey of Moab, in the cop of Phasga, that biholdith ayens the deseert.
Forsothe Israel sente messangeris to Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, and seide,
Y biseche that it be leueful to me to passe thorou thi loond; we schulen not bowe in to the feeldis and vyneris; we schulen not drynke watris of pittis; we schulen go in the kyngis weie, til we passen thi termes.
Which nolde graunte that Israel schulde passe thury hise coostis, but rather, whanne the oost was gaderid, he yede out ayens Israel, in to deseert. And he cam in to Yasa, and fauyt ayens Israel;
of whom he was smytun in the scharpnesse of swerd, and his lond was weldid fro Arnon `til to Jeboth and `the sones of Amon; for the termes of Amonytis weren holdun bi strong help.
Therfor Israel took alle `the citees of hym, and dwelliden in the citees of Amorrei, that is, in Esebon, and hise townes.
The citee of Esebon was Seons, kyng of Ammorei, which Seon fauyt ayens the kyng of Moab, and took al the lond that was of his lordschip, `til to Arnon.
Therfor it is seid in prouerbe, Come ye in to Esebon, be it bildid, and maad the citee of Seon;
fier yede out of Esebon, flawme yede out of the citee `ethir greet castel of Seon, and deuouryde Ar of Moabitis, and the dwelleris of the `hiye places of Arnon.
Moab, wo to thee! thou, puple of Chamos, perischidist; it yaf the sones therof in to fliyt, and the douytris in to caitifte to Seon, kyng of Ammoreis;
the yok of hem perischide, fro Esebon `til to Dibon; the wery men camen in to Jophe, and `til to Medaba.
And so Israel dwellide in the lond of Ammorrey.
And Moises sente men that schulden aspie Jaser, whos `townes thei token, and weldiden the dwelleris.
And thei turniden hem silf, and stieden bi the weie of Basan. And Og, the kyng of Basan, with al his puple cam ayens hem, to fiyte in Edray.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Drede thou not hym, for Y haue bitake hym, and al his loond, and puple, in thin hoond; and thou schalt do to hym as thou didist to Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, the dwellere of Esebon.
Therfor thei smytiden `bothe hym with hise sones and al his puple, `til to deeth; and thei weldiden `the lond of hym.
And thei yeden forth, and settiden tentis in the feeldi places of Moab, where Jerico is set ouer Jordan.
Forsothe Balach, the sone of Sephor, siy alle thingis whiche Israel hadde do to Ammorrei,
and that men of Moab `hadden dred Israel, and miyten not bere the assailing of him.
And he seide to the grettere men in birthe of Madian, So this puple schal do a wei alle men that dwellen in oure coostis, as an oxe is wont to do awei an eerbe `til to the rootis. Forsothe he, `that is, Balaac, was kyng in that tyme in Moab.
Therfor he sente messangeris to Balaam, the sone of Beor, a fals diuynour, that dwellide on the flood of the lond of the sones of Amon, that thei schulden clepe hym, and schulden seie, Lo! a puple yede out of Egipt, `which puple hilide the face of erthe, and sittith ayens me.
Therfor come thou, and curse this puple, which is strongere than Y, if in ony maner Y may smyte and dryue hym out of my lond; for Y knowe, that he is blissid whom thou blissist, and he is cursid whom thou hast cursid.
The eldere men of Moab and the grettere men in birthe of Madian yeden forth, hauynge in hondis the prijs of fals dyuynyng; and whanne thei hadden come to Balaam, and hadden teld to hym alle the wordis of Balaach, he answeride,
Dwelle ye here to nyyt, and Y schal answere what euer thing the Lord schal seie to me. Sotheli while thei dwelliden at Balaam, God cam, and seide to hym,
What wolen these men at thee `to hem silf?
Balaam answeride, Balaach, the sone of Sephor, kyng of Moabitis, sente to me, and seide, Lo!
a puple which is gon out of Egipt hilide the face of erthe; come thou, and curse hem, if in ony maner Y may fiyte, and dryue hym awey.
And God seide to Balaam, Nyle thou go with hem, nether curse thou the puple, for it is blessid.
Which Balaam roos eerli, and seide to the princes, Go ye in to youre lond, for God forbeed me to come with you.
The princes turneden ayen, and seiden to Balaach, Balaam nolde come with vs.
Eft Balaach sente many mo and noblere men, than he hadde sent bifore;
whiche seiden, whanne thei hadden come to Balaam, Balaach, the sone of Sephor, seith thus, Tarye thou not to come to me, redi to onoure thee;
and what euer thing thou wolt, Y schal yyue to thee; come thou, and curse this puple.
Balaam answeride, Thouy Balaach schal yyue to me his howsful of siluer and of gold, Y schal not mowe chaunge the word of my God, that Y speke ethir more ethir lesse.
Y biseche, that ye dwelle here also in this nyyt, that Y may wite what the Lord schal answere eft to me.
Therfor the Lord cam to Balaam in the nyyt, and seide to hym, If these men comen to clepe thee, rise thou, and go with hem, so oneli that thou do that that Y schal comaunde to thee.
Balaam roos eerli, and whanne his femal asse was sadelid, he yede forth with hem.
And God was wrooth. And the `aungel of the Lord stood in the weie ayens Balam, that sat on the femal asse, and hadde twei children with hym.
The femal asse siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, with swerd drawun, and `turnede a wei hir silf fro the weie, and yede bi the feeld. And whanne Balaam beet hir, and wolde lede ayen to the path,
the aungel stood in the streitnessis of twei wallis, with whiche the vyneris weren cumpassid.
And the femal asse siy the aungel, and ioynede hir silf to the wal, and hurtlide the foot of the sittere; and he beet eft `the asse.
And neuer the lesse the aungel yede to the streit place, where me `myyte not go out of the weie, nether to the riyt side nether to the left side, and stood ayens hym.
And whanne the femal asse siy the aungel stondynge, sche felde doun vndir the feet of the sittere, which was wrooth ful greetli, and beet hir sidis with a staaf.
And the Lord openyde the `mouth of the femal asse, and sche spak, What have Y doon to thee? whi smytist thou me, lo! now the thridde tyme?
Balaam answeride, For thou hast disserued, and hast scornyd me; Y wolde that Y hadde a swerd to sle thee.
And the femal asse seide, Whether Y am not thi beeste on which thou were wont to sitte euere til in to this present dai? seie thou, what lijk thing Y dide euere to thee? And he seide, Neuere.
Anoon the Lord openyde `the iyen of Balaam, and he siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, holdynge a drawun swerd in the hoond; and Balaam worschipide hym lowli in to erthe.
To whom the aungel seide, Whi `betist thou thi femal asse `the thridde tyme? Y cam to be aduersarie to thee, for thi weie is weiward, and contrarye to me;
and if the femal asse hadde not bowid a wey fro the weie, and youe place to ayenstondere, Y hadde slayn thee, and sche schulde lyue.
Balaam seide, Y synnede, not witynge that thou stodist ayens me; and now, if it displesith thee that Y go, Y schal turne ayen.
The aungel seide, Go thou with these men, but be war that thou speke not other thing than Y schal comaunde to thee. Therfor Balaam yede with the princes.
And whanne Balaach hadde herde this, he yede out in to the comyng of hym, in the citee of Moabitis, whiche is set in the laste coostis of Arnon.
And he seide to Balaam, Y sente messangeris to clepe thee; whi camest thou not anoon to me? whethir for Y may not yelde meede to thi comyng?
To whom Balaam answeride, Lo! Y am present, whethir Y schal mow speke other thing than that, that God schal putte in my mouth?
Therfor thei yeden forth to gidere, and camen in to a citee, which was in the laste coost of `his rewme.
And whanne Balaach hadde slayn scheep and oxun, he sente yiftis to Balaam and the princes that weren with hym.
Forsothe whanne the morewtid was maad, Balaach ledde Balaam to the hiye placis of Baal, and he bihelde the laste part of the puple, `that is, al the oost til to the laste part.
And Balaam seide to Balaach, Bilde thou here to me seuene auteris, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre.
And whanne he hadde do bi the word of Balaam, thei puttiden a calf and a ram to gidere on the auter.
And Balaam seide to Balaach, Stond thou a litil while bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go, if in hap the Lord meete me; and Y schal `speke to thee what euer thing he schal comaunde.
And whanne he hadde go swiftli, God cam to hym; and Balaam spak to hym, and seide, Y reiside seuene auteris, and Y puttide a calf and a ram aboue.
Forsothe the Lord `puttide a word in his mouth, and seide, Turne ayen to Balaach, and thou schalt speke these thingis.
He turnede ayen, and fond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and alle the princes of Moabitis.
And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Balaach, the kyng of Moabitis, brouyte me fro Aran, fro the `hillis of the eest; and he seide, Come thou and curse Jacob; haaste thou, and greetli curse thou Israel.
How schal Y curse whom God cursid not? bi what resoun schal Y `haue abhomynable whom God `hath not abhomynable?
Fro the hiyeste flyntis Y schal se hym, and fro litle hillis Y schal biholde hym; the puple schal dwelle aloone, and it schal not be arettid among hethene men.
Who may noumbre the dust, that is, kynrede, of Jacob, and knowe the noumbre of the generacioun of Israel? My lijf die in the deeth of iust men, and my laste thingis be maad lijk hem!
And Balaach seide to Balaam, What is this that thou doist? Y clepide thee, that thou schuldist curse myn enemyes, and ayenward thou blessist hem.
To whom Balaam answeride, Whether Y may speke othir thing no but that that the Lord comaundith?
Therfor Balaach seide to Balaam, Come with me in to anothir place, fro whennus thou se a part of Israel, and mayst not se al; fro thennus curse thou hym.
And whanne he hadde led Balaam in to an hiy place, on the cop of the hil of Phasga, he bildide seuene auteris to Balaam, and whanne calues and rammes weren put aboue,
he seide to Balaach, Stonde here bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go.
And whanne the Lord hadde `come to him, and hadde put `a word in his mouth, he seide, Turne ayen to Balach, and thou schalt seie these thingis to hym.
He turnyde ayen, and foond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and the princis of Moabitis with hym. To whom Balach seide, What spak the Lord?
And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Stonde, Balach, and herkene; here, thou sone of Sephor. God is not `as a man,
that he lye, nethir he is as the sone of a man, that he be chaungid; therfor he seide, and schal he not do? he spak, and schal he not fulfille?
Y am brouyt to blesse, Y may not forbede blessyng.
Noon idol is in Jacob, nethir symylacre is seyn in Israel; his Lord God is with hym, and the sown of victorie of kyng is in hym.
The Lord God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn;
fals tellyng bi chiteryng of bryddis, `ethir idolatrie, is not in Jacob, nethir fals dyuynyng is in Israel. In his tymes it schal be seide to Jacob and Israel, What the Lord hath wrought!
Lo! the puple schal rise to gidere as a lionesse, and schal be reisid as a lioun; the lioun schal not reste, til he deuoure prey, and drynke the blood of hem that ben slayn.
And Balach seide to Balaam, Nether curse thou, nether blesse thou hym.
And he seide, Whether Y seide not to thee, that what euer thing that God comaundide to me, Y wolde do this?
And Balach seide to hym, Come, and Y schal lede thee to an other place, if in hap it plesith God that fro thennus thou curse hym.
And whanne Balaach hadde led hym out on the `cop of the hil of Phegor, that biholdith the wildirnesse,
Balaam seide to hym, Bilde here seuene auteris to me, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre.
Balaach dide as Balaam seide, and he puttide caluys and rammes, bi alle auteris.
And whanne Balaam siy that it pleside the Lord that he schulde blesse Israel, he yede not as he `hadde go bifore, `that he schulde seke fals dyuynyng `bi chiteryng of briddis, but he dresside his face ayens the desert,
and reiside iyen, and siy Israel dwellynge in tentis bi hise lynagis. And whanne the Spirit of God felde on hym, and whanne a parable was takun,
he seide, Balaam, the sone of Beor, seide, a man whois iye is stoppid seide,
the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which bihelde the reuelacioun of almyyti God, which fallith doun, and hise iyen ben openyd so, Hou faire ben thi tabernaclis,
Jacob, and thi tentis, Israel!
as valeys ful of woodis, and moiste gardyns bisidis floodis, as tabernaclis whiche the Lord hath set, as cedris bisidis watris;
watir schal flowe of his bokat, and his seed schal be in to many watris, `that is, puplis. The kyng of hym schal be takun a wei for Agag, and the rewme of hym schal be doon awai.
God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn; thei schulen deuoure hethene men, enemyes `of hym, that is, of Israel; and thei schulen breke the boonus of hem, and schulen perse with arowis.
He restide and slepte as a lyoun, and as a lionesse, whom no man schal dore reise. He that blessith thee, schal be blessid; he that cursith, schal
be arettid in to cursyng And Balaach was wrooth ayens Balaam, and seide, whanne the hondis weren wrungun to gidere, I clepide thee to curse myn enemyes, whiche ayenward thou hast blessid thries.
Turne ayen to thi place; forsothe Y demede to onoure thee greetli, but the Lord priuyde thee fro onour disposid.
Balaam answeride to Balaach, Whethir Y seide not to thi messangeris, whiche thou sentist to me,
Thouy Balaach schal yyue to me his hows ful of siluer and of gold, Y schal not mow passe the word of my Lord God, that Y brynge forth of myn herte ony thing, ethir of good ethir of yuel, but what euer thing the Lord schal seie, Y schal speke this?
Netheles Y schal go to my puple, and Y schal yyue counsel to thee, what thi puple schal do in the laste tyme to this puple.
Therfor whanne a parable was takun, he seide eft, Balaam, the sone of Beor seide, a man whos iye is stoppid,
seide, the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which knowith the doctrine of the hiyeste, and seeth the reuelacioun of almiyti God, which fallith doun and hath opyn iyen,
Y schal se hym, but not now; Y schal biholde hym, but not nyy; a sterre schal be borun of Jacob, and a yerde schal rise of Israel; and he schal smyte the duykis of Moab, and he schal waste alle the sones of Seth; and Ydumye schal be hys possessioun,
the eritage of Seir schal bifalle to his enemyes; forsothe Israel schal do strongli, of Jacob schal be he that schal be lord,
and schal leese the relikis of the citee.
And whanne he hadde seyn Amalech, he took a parable, and seide, Amalech is the bigynning of hethene men, whos laste thingis schulen be lost.
Also `he siy Cyney, and whanne a parable was takun, he seide, Forsothe thi dwellyng place is strong, but if thou schalt sette thi nest in a stoon,
and schalt be chosun of the generacioun of Cyn, hou longe schalt thou mow dwelle? forsothe Assur schal take thee.
And whanne a parable was takun, he spak eft, Alas! who schal lyue, whanne the Lord schal make thes thingis?
Thei schulen come in grete schippis fro Ytalie, thei schulen ouercome Assiries, and thei schulen distrie Ebrews, and at the last also thei hem silf schulen perische.
And Balaam roos, and turnide ayen in to his place; and Balaach yede ayen bi the weye in which he cam.
Forsothe in that tyme Israel dwellide in Sechym; and the puple dide fornycacioun with the douytris of Moab;
whiche douytris clepiden hem to her sacrifices, and thei eten, and worschipiden the goddis of tho douytris;
and Israel made sacrifice to Belphegor. And the Lord was wrooth,
and seide to Moises, Take thou alle the princes of the puple, and hange hem ayens the sunne in iebatis, that my wodnesse, `that is stronge veniaunce, be turned awai fro Israel.
And Moises seide to the iugis of Israel, Ech man sle his neiyboris, that maden sacrifice to Belphagor.
And, lo! oon of the sones of Israel entride bifor his britheren to `an hoore of Madian, in the siyt of Moises, and al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, whiche wepten bifor the yatis of the tabernacle.
And whanne Phynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, hadde seyn this, he roos fro the myddis of the multitude; and whanne he hadde take a swerd,
he entride aftir the man of Israel in to the `hoore hows, and stikide thorou both togidere, that is, the man and the womman, in the places of gendryng. And the veniaunce ceesside fro the sones of Israel,
and foure and twenti thousand of men weren slayn.
And the Lord seide to Moises,
Fynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, turnede away myn yre fro the sones of Israel; for he was stirid ayens hem bi my feruent loue, that Y my silf schulde not do awai the sones of Israel in my greet hete, `ether strong veniaunce.
Therfor speke thou to hym, Lo! Y yyue to hym the pees of my couenaunt,
and it schal be an euerlastynge couenaunt of preesthod, as wel to hym silf as to his seed; for he louyde feruentli for his God, and he clenside the greet trespas of the sones of Israel.
Forsothe the name of the man of Israel, that was slayn with the womman of Madian, was Zambri, the sone of Salu, duyk of the kynrede and lynage of Symeon.
Forsothe the womman of Madian that was slayn togidere, was clepid Cobri, the douyter of Sur, the nobleste prince of Madianytis.
And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
`Madianytis feele you enemyes, and smyte ye hem;
for also thei diden enemyliche ayens you, and disseyueden thorow tresouns, bi the idol of Phegor, and bi `the douyter of Corbri, duyk of Madian, her sister, which douyter was sleyn in the dai of veniaunce, for the sacrilege of Phegor.

Aftir that the blood of gilti men was sched out, the Lord seide to Moises and to Eleasar,
preest, sone of Aaron, Noumbre ye al the summe of the sones of Israel, fro twenti yeer and aboue, bi her housis, and kynredis, alle men that mowen go forth to batels.
And so Moises and Eleasar, preest, spaken in the feeldi places of Moab, ouer Jordan, ayens Jerico, to hem that weren of twenti yeer and aboue,
as the Lord comaundide; of whiche this is the noumbre.
Ruben, the firste gendrid of Israel; the sone of hym was Enoch, of whom was the meynee of Enochitis; and Phallu, of whom the meynee of Phalluytis; and Esrom,
of whom the meynee of Esromytis; and Charmy, of whom the meynee of Charmytis.
Thes weren the meynees of the generacioun of Ruben, of whiche meynees the noumbre was foundun thre and fourti thousand seuene hundrid and thretti.

And Moises telde to the sones of Israel alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to hym.
And he spak to the princes of the lynagis of the sones of Israel, This is the word, which the Lord comaundide, If ony of men makith a vowe to the Lord,
ethir byndith hym silf bi an ooth, he schal not make voide his word, but he schal fille al thing which he bihiyte.
If a womman which is in the hows of hir fadir, and is yit in the age of a damysel, `that is, not yit weddid, avowith ony thing, ethir byndith hir silf bi an ooth, `if the fadir knowith the avow, which sche bihiyte, and the ooth bi which sche boond hir soule, and he is stille, sche schal be gilti of the ooth, that is, boundun bi the ooth;
what euer thing sche bihiyte and swoor, sche schall fille in werk.
Forsothe if the fadir ayenseide anoon as he herde, bothe the vowis and `oothis of hir schulen be voide, and sche schal not be holdun boundun to the biheeste, for the fadir ayenseide.
If sche hath an hosebonde, and avowith ony thing, and a word goynge out of hir mouth onys byndith hir soule with an ooth,
in what dai the hosebonde herith, and ayenseith not, sche schal be gilti `of avow; sche schal yelde, what euer thing sche bihiyte.
But if the hosebonde herith, and anoon ayenseith, and makith void alle hir biheestis, and wordis bi whiche sche boond hir soule, the Lord schal be merciful to hir.
A widewe, and a womman forsakun of hir hosebonde, schulen yelde, what euer thing thei avowen.
Whanne a wijf in `the hous of hir hosebonde byndith hir silf bi a vow and an ooth,
if the hosebonde herith, and is stille and ayenseith not the biheest, sche schal yelde, what euer thing sche bihiyte.
Sotheli if the hosebonde ayenseide anoon, sche schal not be holdun gilti of biheest, for the hosebonde ayenseide, and the Lord schal be merciful to hir.
If sche avowith, and byndith hir silf bi an ooth, that sche turmente hir soule bi fastyng, ethir bi abstynence of othere thingis, it schal be in the doom of the hosebonde, that sche do, ether do not.
That if the hosebonde herith, and is stille, and delaieth the sentence in the tother dai, sche schal yelde what euer thing sche avowide and bihiyte, for he was stille, anoon as he herde.
Forsothe if the hosebonde ayenseide aftir that he wiste, he schal bere his wickidnesse. These ben the lawis, which the Lord ordeynede to Moyses bitwixe the hosebonde and the wijf, bitwixe the fadir and the douytir, which is yit in the age of a damysel, `that is, not yit maried, `ether which dwellith in `the hows of the fadir.
And the Lord spak to Moyses, and seide,
Venge thou firste the sones of Israel of Madianytis, and so thou schalt be gaderid to thi puple.
And anoon Moises seide, Arme ye men of you to batel, that moun take of Madianytis the veniaunce of the Lord.
Of ech lynage be chosun a thousynde men of Israel, that schulen be sent to batel.
And of ech lynage thei yauen a thousynde, that is twelue thousynde of men, redi to batel;
whiche Moises sente with Fynees, the sone of Eleazar, preest. And he bitook to hem hooli vesselis, and trumpis to make sown.
And whanne thei hadden fouyt ayens Madianytis, and hadden ouercome, thei killiden alle the malis,
and `the kyngis of hem, Euy, and Reem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, fyue princes of `the folc of hem. Also thei killiden bi swerd Balaam, the sone of Beor.
And thei token the wymmen of hem, and the litle children, and alle beestis, and al purtenaunce of howshold; what euer thei myyten haue, thei spuyleden;
flawme brente as wel citees, as litle townes and castels.
And they token pray, and alle thingis whiche thei hadden take, as wel of men as of beestis, and thei brouyten to Moyses,
and to Eleazar, preest, and to al the multitude of the sones of Israel. Forsothe thei baren othere `thingis perteynynge to vss, to the castels in the feldi places of Moab bisidis Jordan, ayens Jericho.
Moises and Eleazar, preest, and alle the princes of the synagoge, yeden out in to the comyng of hem, with out the castels, `that is, of the tabernacle.
And Moises was wrooth to the princes of the oost, to tribunes, and centuriouns, that camen fro batel;
and he seide, Whi reserueden ye wymmen?
whether it be not these that disseyueden the sones of Israel, at the suggestioun of Balaam, and maden you to do trespas ayens the Lord, on the synne of Phegor, wherfor also the puple was slayn?
And therfor sle ye alle men, what euer thing is of male kynde, and litle children; and strangle ye the wymmen that knew men fleischli;
forsothe reserue ye to you damesels, and alle wymmen virgyns,
and dwelle ye with out the castels in seuene daies. He that sleeth a man, ether touchith a slayn man, schal be clensid in the thridde and the seuenthe dai;
and of al the pray, whether it is clooth, ether vessel, and ony thing maad redi in to thingis perteynynge to vss, of the skynnys and heeris of geet, and `of tre, it schal be clensid.
And Eleazar, preest, spak thus to the men of the oost that fouyten, This is the comaundement of the lawe, which the Lord comaundide to Moises,
The gold, and siluer, and bras, and yrun, and tiyn, and leed, and al thing that may passe by flawme, schal be purgid bi fier;
sotheli what euer thing may not suffre fier, schal be halewid bi the watir of clensyng.
And ye schulen waische youre clothis in the seuenthe dai, and ye schulen be clensid; and aftirward ye schulen entre in to the castels `of the tabernacle.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Take ye the summe of tho thingis that ben takun, fro man `til to beeste,
thou, and Eleazar, preest, and alle the princes of the comyn puple.
And thou schalt departe euenli the prey bytwixe hem that fouyten and yeden out to batel, and bitwixe al the multitude.
And thou schalt departe a part to the Lord, of hem that fouyten, and weren in batel, `o soule of fiue hundrid, as wel of men, as of oxun, and of assis, and of scheep.
And thou schalt yyue `that part to Eleazar, preest, for tho ben the firste fruytis of the Lord.
Also of the myddil part of the sones of Israel, thou schalt take the fiftithe heed of men, and of oxun, and of assis, and of scheep, and of alle lyuynge beestis; and thou schalt yyue tho to the dekenes, that waken in the kepyngis of the tabernacle of the Lord.
And Moyses and Eleazar diden, as the Lord comaundide.
Forsothe the prey which the oost hadde take, was sixe hundrid fyue and seuenti thousynde of scheep,
of oxun two and seuenti thousynde,
of assis sixti thousynde and a thousynde;
the soules of persones of femal kynde, that knewen not fleischli men, two and thretti thousynde.
And the myddil part was youun to hem that weren in the batel, of scheep thre hundrid seuene and thretti thousynde and fyue hundrid;
of whiche sixe hundrid fyue and seuenti scheep weren noumbrid in to the part of the Lord;

two and seuenti oxun, and of thretti thousynde assis and fyue hundryd, oon and sixti assis;
of sixtene thousynde persoones of men, twei and thretti persoones bifelden in to the `part of the Lord.
And Moises bitook the noumbre of the firste fruytis of the Lord to Eleazar, preest, as it was comaundid to hym,
of the myddil part of the sones of Israel, which he departide to hem that weren in batel.
And of the myddil part that bifelde to the tother multitude, that is, of thre hundrid seuene and thretti thousynde scheep and fyue hundrid,
and of sixe and thretti thousynde oxun,
and of thretti thousynde assis and fyue hundrid, and of sixtene thousynde wymmen,
Moyses took the fyftithe heed,
and yaf to the dekenes, that wakiden in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord comaundide.
And whanne the princes of the oost, and the tribunes and centuriouns hadden neiyed to Moises,
thei seiden, We thi seruauntis han teld the noumbre of fiyters, whiche we hadden vndur oure hoond, and sotheli not oon failide;
for which cause we offren `in the fre yiftis of the Lord, alle bi vs silf, that that we myyten fynde of gold in the pray, girdelis for `the myddil of wymmen, and bies of the armes, and ryngis, and ournementis of the arm nyy the hond, and bies of the neckis of wymmen, that thou preye the Lord for vs.
And Moises and Eleazar, preest, token al the gold in dyuerse spices,
`ether kyndis, bi the weiyte of the seyntuarye, sixtene thousynde seuene hundrid and fifti siclis, of the tribunes, and centuriouns.
For that that ech man rauyschide in the prey, was his owne;
and thei baren the gold taken in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, in to the mynde of the sones of Israel, bifor the Lord.
Forsothe the sones of Ruben and of Gad hadden many beestis, and catel with out noumbre was to hem, in werk beestis. And whanne thei hadden seyn Jazer and Galaad, couenable londis to beestis to be fed,
thei camen to Moyses and Eleazar, preest, and to the princes of the multitude, and seiden,
Astaroth, and Dibon, and Jacer, and Nemra, Esebon, and Eleale, and Sabam,
and Nebo, and Beon, the lond which the Lord smoot in the siyt of the sones of Israel, is of moost plenteuous cuntrey to the pasture of beestis; and we thi seruauntis han ful many beestis;
and we preyen, if we han founde grace bifor thee, that thou yyue to vs thi seruauntis that cuntrey in to possessioun, and make not vs to passe Jordan.
To whiche Moises answeride, Whether youre britheren schulen go to batel, and ye schulen sitte here?
Whi peruerten ye the soulis of Israel, that thei doren not passe in to the place, which the Lord schal yyue to hem?
Whether youre fadris diden not so, whanne Y sente fro Cades Barne to aspie the lond,
and whanne thei camen to the valey of Clustre, whanne al the cuntrey was cumpassid, thei peruertiden the herte of the sones of Israel, that thei entriden not in to the coostis, whiche the Lord yaf to hem.
And the Lord was wrooth, and swoor,
seiynge, Thes men that stieden fro Egipt, fro twenti yeer and aboue, schulen not se the lond which Y bihiyte vndur an ooth to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and nolden sue me,
outakun Caleph, Cenezei, the sone of Jephone, and Josue, the sone of Nun; these tweyne filliden my wille.
And the Lord was wrooth ayens Israel, and ledde hym aboute the deseert bi fourti yeer, til al the generacioun was wastid, that hadde do yuel in the `siyt of the Lord.
And Moyses seide, Lo! ye encressyngis, and nurreis, `ether nurschid children, of synful men, han ryse for youre fadris, that ye schulden encreesse the strong veniaunce of the Lord ayens Israel.
That if ye nylen sue the Lord, in `the wildirnesse he schal forsake the puple, and ye schulen be cause of the deeth of alle men.
And thei neiyiden nyy, and seiden, We schulen make foldis of scheep, and the stablis of beestis, and we schulen make strengthid citees to oure litle children.
Forsothe we vs silf schulen be armed `to defence, and schulen be gird `with armeris to asailyng, and schulen go to batel bifor the sones of Israel, til we bryngen hem in to her places; oure litle children and what euer thing we moun haue, schulen be in strengthid cytees, for the tresouns of the dwelleris.
We schulen not turne ayen in to oure housis, til the sones of Israel welden her eritage;
and we schulen not axe ony thing ouer Jordan, for we han now oure possessioun in the eest coost therof.
To whiche Moises seide, If ye doen that, that ye biheten, be ye maad redi, and go ye to batel bifor the Lord;
and ech man fiytere be armed, and passe Jordan, til the Lord distrye hise enemyes,
and al the lond be maad suget to hym; thanne ye schulen be giltles anentis God, and anentis Israel, and ye schulen holde the cuntreys, whiche ye wolen, bifor the Lord.
But if ye doon not that, that ye seien, it is not doute to ony man, that ne ye synnen ayens God; and wite ye, that youre synne schal take you.
Therfor bilde ye citees to youre litle children, and foldis and stablis to scheep, and to beestis; and fille ye that, that ye bihiyten.
And the sones of Gad and of Ruben seiden to Moises, We ben thi seruauntis; we schulen do that, that oure lord comaundith.
We schulen leeue oure litle children, and wymmen, and scheep, and beestis in the citees of Galaad;
forsothe alle we thi seruauntis schulen go redi to batel, as thou, lord, spekist.
Therfor Moyses comaundide to Eleazar, preest, and to Josue, the sone of Nun, and to the princes of meynees, bi the lynagis of Israel, and seide to hem,
If the sones of Gad, and the sones of Ruben goen alle armed with you, to batel bifor the Lord, and the lond be maad suget to you, yyue ye to hem Galaad in to possessioun;
but if thei nylen passe with you in to the lond of Chanaan, take thei places to dwelle among you.
And the sones of Gad and the sones of Ruben answeriden, As the Lord spak to hise seruauntis, so we schulen do;
we schulen go armed bifor the Lord, in to the lond of Chanaan, and we knowlechen, that we han take now possessioun ouer Jordan.
And so Moises yaf to the sones of Gad and of Ruben, and to half the lynage of Manasses, sone of Joseph, the rewme of Seon, kyng of Ammorey, and the rewme of Og, kyng of Basan, and `the lond of hem, with her citees, bi cumpas.
Therfor the sones of Gad bildiden Dibon, and Astaroth, and Aroer,
and Roth-Sophan, and Jazer, and Jebaa,
and Beeth-Nemra, and Betharan, strengid citees; and foldis to her beestis.
Forsothe the sones of Ruben bildiden Esebon, and Eleale, and Cariathiarym, and Nabo,
and Balmeon, whanne the names weren turned, and thei bildiden Sabama; and puttiden names to the citees, whiche thei hadden bildid.
Forsothe the sones of Machir, sone of Manasses, yeden in to Galaad, and distrieden it, and killiden Ammorei, enhabitere therof.
Therfor Moises yaf the lond of Galaad to Machir, sone of Manasses, which Machir dwellide ther ynne.
Forsothe Jair, the sone of Manasses, yede, and occupiede the townes therof, whiche he clepide Anochiair, that is, the townes of Jair.
Also Nobe yede, and took Canath, with hise townes, and clepide it, bi his name, Nobe.
These ben the dwellyngis of the sones of Israel, that yeden out of the lond of Egipt, bi her cumpenyes, in the hond of Moises and of Aaron;
whiche dwellyngis Moises discriuede bi the places of tentis, that weren chaungid bi comaundement of the Lord.
Therfor the sones of Israel yeden forth in `an hiy hond fro Ramesses, in the firste monethe, in the fiftenthe dai of the firste monethe, in the tother dai of pask, while alle Egipcians sien,
and birieden the firste gendrid children, whiche the Lord hadde slayn; for the Lord hadde take veniaunce also on the goddis `of hem.
`The sones of Israel settiden tentis in Socoth,

And thei yeden fro Cades, and thei settiden tentis in the hil of Hor, in the laste coostis of the lond of Edom.
And Aaron, the preest, stiede in to the hil of Hor, for the Lord comaundide, and there he was deed, in the fourti yeer of the goyng out of the sones of Israel fro Egipt, in the fyuethe monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe;
whanne he was of an hundrid and thre and twenti yeer.

And thei yeden forth fro the hil of Hor, and settiden tentis in Salmona;

And thei yeden out fro Helmon of Deblathaym, and camen to the hillis of Abarym, ayens Nabo.
And thei yeden forth fro the hillis of Abarym, and passiden to the feeldi places of Moab, ouer Jordan, ayens Jericho.
And there thei settiden tentis, fro Bethsymon `til to Belsathym, in the pleynere places of Moabitis,
where the Lord spak to Moises,
Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, and seie thou to hem, Whanne ye han passid Jordan, and han entrid in to the lond of Canaan,
distrie ye alle the dwelleris of that cuntrey; breke ye the titlis, `that is, auteris, and dryue ye to poudre the ymagis, and distrie ye alle heiy thingis,
and clense ye the lond, and alle men dwellynge thereynne. For Y yaf to
you that lond into possessioun whiche ye schulen departe to you bi lot; to mo men ye schulen yyue largere lond, and to fewere men streytere lond, as lot fallith to alle men, so eritage schal be youun; possessioun schal be departid bi lynagis and meynees.
But if ye nylen sle the dwelleris of the lond, thei, that abiden, schulen be to you as nailes in the iyen, and speris in the sidis, `that is, deedli aduersaries; and thei schulen be aduersaries to you in the lond of youre abitacioun;
and what euer thing Y thouyte to do `to hem, Y schal do to you.
And the Lord spak to Moises,
and seide, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of Canaan, and it bifelde in to possessioun `to you bi lot, it schal be endid bi these endis.
The south part schal bigynne at the wildirnesse of Syn, which is bisidis Edom, and it schal haue termes ayens the eest,
the saltiste see, whiche termes schulen cumpasse the south coost bi the `stiynge of Scorpioun, `that is, of an hil clepid Scorpioun, so that tho passe in to Senna, and come to the south, `til to Cades Barne; fro whennus the coostis schulen go out to the town, Abdar bi name, and schulen strecche forth `til to Asemona;
and the terme schal go bi cumpas fro Assemona `til to the stronde of Egipt, and it schal be endid bi the brynke of the grete see.
Forsothe the west coost schal bigynne at the greet see, and schal be closid bi that ende.
Sotheli at the north coost, the termes schulen bigynne at the greet see, and schulen come `til to the hiyeste hil,
fro which tho schulen come in to Emath, `til to the termes of Sedada;
and the coostis schulen go `til to Ephrona, and the town of Enan. These schulen be the termes in the north part.
Fro thennus thei schulen mete coostis ayens the eest coost, fro the town Henan `til to Sephama;
and fro Sephama termes schulen go doun in to Reblatha, ayens the welle `of Daphnyn; fro thennus tho schulen come ayens the eest to the se of Cenereth;
and tho schulen strecche forth `til to Jordan, and at the laste tho schulen be closid with the salteste see. Ye schulen haue this lond bi hise coostis `in cumpas.
And Moises comaundide to the sones of Israel, and seide, This schal be the lond which ye schulen welde bi lot, and which the Lord comaundide to be youun to nyne lynagis and to the half lynage;
for the lynage of the sones of Ruben, bi her meynees, and the lynage of the sones of Gad, bi kynrede and noumbre, and half the lynage of Manasses,
that is, twey lynagis and an half, han take her part ouer Jordan, ayens Jerico, at the eest coost.
And the Lord seide to Moises,
These ben the `names of men that schulen departe the lond to you, Eleazar, preest, and Josue, the sone of Nun, and of each lynage, o prynce;
of whiche these ben the names, of the lynage of Juda,
Caleph, the sone of Jephone;
of the lynage of Symeon, Samuhel, the sone of Amyud;
of the lynage of Beniamyn, Heliad, sone of Casselon;
of the lynage of the sones of Dan, Bochi, sone of Jogli; of the sones of Joseph,
of the lynage of Manasses, Hamyel, sone of Ephoth;
of the lynage of Effraym, Camuhel, sone of Septhan;
of the lynage of Zabulon, Elisaphan, sone of Pharnat;
of the lynage of Isacar, duyk Phaltiel, the sone of Ozan; of the lynage of Azer,
Abyud, the sone of Salomy;
of the lynage of Neptalym, Fedahel, the sone of Amyud.
These men it ben, to whiche the Lord comaundide, that thei schulden departe to the sones of Israel the lond of Chanaan.
And the Lord spak these thingis to Moises, in the feeldi places of Moab, aboue Jordan,
ayens Jericho, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, that thei yyue to dekenes of her possessiouns,
citees to dwelle, and the suburbabis of tho bi cumpas, that thei dwelle in `the citees, and the suburbabis be to beestis, and `werk beestis;
whiche suburbabis schulen be strecchid forth fro the wallis of citees with outforth `bi cumpas, in the space of a thousynde paacis;
ayens the eest schulen be two thousynde cubitis, and ayens the south in lijk manere schulen be two thousynde cubitis, and at the see that biholdith to the west schal be the same mesure, and the north coost schal be endid bi euene terme. And the citees schulen be in the myddis, and the suburbabis with outforth.
Forsothe of tho citees whiche ye schulen yyue to dekenes, sixe schulen be departid in to helpis of fugityues, `ether of fleynge men, that he that schedde blood, fle to tho; and outakun these sixe, ye schulen yyue to dekenes othere two and fourti citees,
that is, togidere eiyte and fourti, with her surburbabis.
And tho citees that schulen be youun of the possessiouns of sones of Israel, schulen be takun awey, mo fro hem that han more, and fewere `schulen be takun awey fro hem that han lesse, alle bi hem silf schulen yyue bi the mesure of her eritage, citees to dekenes.
The Lord seide to Moises,
Spek thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne ye han passid Jordan, in the lond of Canaan,
deme ye whiche citees owen to be in to the helpis of fugityues, whiche not wilfuli han sched blood.
In whiche whanne the fleere hath fled, the kynesman of hym that is slayn, schal not mow sle hym, til he stonde in the siyt of the multitude, and the cause of hym be demed.
Forsothe of tho citees that ben departid to the helpis of fugityues,
thre schulen be ouer Jordan, and thre in the lond of Canaan;
as wel to the sones of Israel as to comelyngis and pilgryms; that he fle to tho citees, that schedde blood not wilfuli.
If ony man smytith a man with yrun, and he that is smytun is deed, `the smyter schal be gilti of mansleyng, and he schal die.
If he castith a stoon, and a man is deed bi the strook, he schal be punyschid in lijk maner.
If a man smytun with a staf dieth, he schal be vengid bi `the blood of the smytere.
The niy kynesman of hym that is slayn schal sle the mansleere; anoon as he takith hym, `that is, the manquellere, he schal sle hym.
If bi haterede a man hurtlith, `ethir schoufith, `a man, ethir castith ony thing in to hym bi aspiyngis,
ether whanne he was enemy, smoot with hond, and he is deed, the smytere schal be gilti of mansleyng. The kynesman `of him that is slayn, anoon as he findith him, `that is, the sleere, schal sle hym.
That if bi sudeyn caas, and without hatrede and enemytees,
he doith ony thing of these;
and this is preued in heryng `of the puple, and the questioun of blood is discussid bitwixe the smytere and the kynesman,
the innocent schal be delyuered fro the hond of the vengere, and bi sentence of iugis he schal be led ayen in to the citee, to which he fledde, and he schal dwelle there, til the grete preest die, which is anoyntid with oile.
If the sleere is foundun with out the coostis `of the citees that ben asigned to exilid men,
and is slayn of him that is vengere, he that sleeth him, `that is, the exilid man, schal be with out gilt;
for the exilid man ouyte sitte in the citee `til to the `deth of the bischop; forsothe aftir that thilke bischop is deed, the mansleere schal turne ayen in to his lond.
These schulen be euerlastynge and lawful thingis in alle youre dwellyngis.
A mansleere schal be punyschid vndur witnessis; no man schal `be dampned at the witnessyng of o man.
Ye schulen not take prijs of him which is gilti of blood, anoon and he schal die.
Men exilid, and fugityues, schulen not mow turne ayen in ony maner in to her citees, bifore the deeth of the bischop, lest ye defoulen the lond of youre abitacioun,
which is defoulid bi the blood of innocent men; and it may not be clensid in other maner, no but bi the blood of hym, that schedde the blood of anothir man.
And so youre possessioun schal be clensid, for Y schal dwelle with you; for Y am the Lord, that dwelle among the sones of Israel.
Forsothe and the princes of the meynees of Galaad sone of Machir, sone of Manasses, of the generacioun of the sones of Joseph, neiyiden, and spaken to Moises bifor the princes of Israel,
and seiden, The Lord comaundide to thee oure lord, that thou schuldist departe the lond bi lot to the sones of Israel, and that thou schuldist yyue to the douytris of Salphaat, oure brothir, possessioun due to the fadir.
And if men of anothir lynage schulen take to wyues these douytris, her possessioun schal sue, and it schal be translatid to anothir lynage, and schal be decreessid fro oure eritage;
and so it schal be doon, that whanne the iubilee, that is, the fiftithe yeer of remyssioun, cometh, the departyng of lottis be schent, and that the possessioun of othere men passe to othere men.
Moises answeride to the sones of Israel, and seide, for the Lord comaundide, The lynage of the sones of Joseph spak riytfuli,
and this lawe is denounsid of the Lord on the douytris of Salphaat; be thei weddid to whiche men thei wolen, oneli to the men of her lynage;
lest the possessioun of the sones of Joseph be meddlid fro lynage in to lynage. For alle men schulen wedde wyues of her lynage and kynrede;
and alle wymmen schulen take hosebondis of the same lynage, that the erytage dwelle in meynees,
and lynagis be not meddlid to hem silf, but dwelle so,
as tho ben departid of the Lord. And the douytris of Salphaat diden, as it was comaundid to hem.
And Maala, and Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Noha, weren weddid to the sones of her fadris brother,
of the meynee of Manaasses, that was `the sone of Joseph, and the possessioun that was youun to hem, dwellide in the lynage and meynee of her fadir.
These ben the comaundementis and domes, whiche the Lord comaundide, bi the hond of Moyses, to the sones of Israel, in the feeldi places of Moab, aboue Jordan, ayens Jericho.
These ben the wordis whiche Moyses spak to al Israel ouer Jordan, in the wildirnesse of the feeld, ayens the reed see, bitwix Pharan and Tophel and Laban and Asseroth, where is ful myche gold,
by enleuene daies fro Oreb bi the weie of the hil of Seir, til to Cades Barne.
In the fortithe yeer, in the enleuenth monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, Moises spak to the sones of Israel alle thingis whiche the Lord commandide to hym that he schulde seie to hem,
after that he smoot Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, that dwellide in Esebon, and Og, the kyng of Basan, that dwelide in Asseroth and in Edray, ouer Jordan, in the lond of Moab.
And Moyses bigan to declare the lawe, and to seie,
Oure Lord God spak to vs in Oreb, and seide, It suffisith to you that ye han dwellid in this hil;
turne ye ayen, and come ye to the hil of Amorreis, and to othere placis that ben next it; to places of feeldis, and of hillis, and to lowere places ayens the south, and bisidis the brenke of the see, to the lond of Cananeys, and of Liban, `til to the greet flood Eufrates.
Lo, `he seith, Y haue youe to you; entre ye, and `welde ye `that lond on which the Lord swoor to youre fadrys, Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob, that he schulde yyue it to hem, and to her seed after hem.
And Y seide to you in that time, Y may not aloone susteyne you, for youre Lord God hath multiplied you,
and ye ben ful many to dai, as the sterris of heuene;
the Lord God of youre fadris adde to this noumbre many thousyndis, and blesse you, as he spak.
Y may not aloone susteyne youre causis, and birthun, and stryues; yyue ye of you men wise `in dyuyn thingis,
and witti `in mennus thingis worthi to be don, whose conuersacioun is preued in youre lynagis, that Y sette hem princes to you.
Thanne ye answeriden to me, The thing is good which thou wolt do.
And Y took of youre lynagis men wise and noble, `in vertues and kyn; and Y ordeynede hem princis, tribunes, and centuryouns, and quynquagenaries, and denys, whiche schulden teche you all thingis.
And Y comaundide to hem, and seide, Here ye hem, and deme ye that that is iust, whether he be a citeseyn, whether a pilgrym.
No difference schal be of persones; ye schulen here so a litil man, `that is, pore, as a greet man, nether ye schulen take the persoone of ony man, for it is the doom of God. That if ony thing semeth hard to you, telle ye to me, and Y schal here.
And Y comaundide alle thingis whiche ye ouyten to do.
Forsothe we yeden forth fro Oreb, and passiden bi a feerdful deseert, and grettiste wildirnesse, which ye sien, bi the weye of the hil of Ammorrey, as oure Lord God comaundide to vs. And whanne we hadden come in to Cades Barne,
Y seide to you, Ye ben comen to the hil of Ammorrey, which youre Lord God schal yyue to you;
se thou the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee; `stie thou, and welde it, as oure Lord God spak to thi fadris; `nyle thou drede, nether `drede thou in herte ony thing.
And alle ye neiyiden to me, and ye seiden, Sende we men, that schulen biholde the lond, and telle to vs bi what weye we owen stie, and to whiche citees we owen to go.
And whanne the word pleside to me, Y sente of you twelue men, of ech lynage oon.
And whanne thei hadden go, and hadden stied in to the hilli places, thei camen `til to the valei of Clustre; and whanne thei hadden biholde the lond,
thei token of the fruytis therof, to schewe the plentee, and brouyten `to vs, and seiden, The lond is good which oure Lord God schal yyue to vs.
And ye `nolden stie, but ye weren vnbileueful to the word of oure Lord God.
And ye grutchiden in youre tabernaclis, and ye seiden, The Lord hatith vs, and herfor he ledde vs out of the lond of Egipt, that he schulde bitake vs in the hond of Ammorey, and schulde do awei vs.
Whidur schulen we stie? the messangeris maden aferd oure herte, and seiden, A grettiste multitude is, and largere in stature than we; the citees ben greete, and wallid `til to the heuene; we sien there the sones of Enachym, that is, giauntis.
And Y seide to you, `Nyle ye drede `with ynne, nether `drede withoutforth; the Lord God hym silf,
which is youre ledere, schal fiyte for you, as he dide in Egipt, while alle men sien.
And ye sien in the wildirnesse, thi Lord God bar thee, as a man is wont to bere his litil sone, in al the weie bi which ye yeden til ye camen to this place.
And sotheli nether so ye bileueden to youre Lord God, that yede bifor you in the weie,
and mesuride the place in which ye ouyten to sette tentis, and schewide in nyyt the weie to you bi fier, and in dai bi a piler of cloude.
And whanne the Lord hadde herd the vois of youre wordis, he was wrooth,
and swoor, and seide, Noon of the men of this werste generacioun schal se the good lond, which Y bihiyte vndur an ooth to youre fadris,
outakun Caleph, the sone of Jephone; for he schal se it, and Y schal yyue to hym the lond on which he trad, and to hise sones, for he suede the Lord.
Nether the indignacioun ayens the puple is wondirful, sithen the Lord was wrooth also to me for you, and seide,
Nether thou schalt entre thidur, but Josue, the sone of Nun, thi mynystre, he schal entre for thee; excyte and strengthe thou him, and he schal departe the lond bi lot to Israel.
Youre litle children, of whiche ye seiden, that thei schulden be led prisoneris, and the sones that kunnen not to dai the diuersite of good and of yuel, thei schulen entre; and Y schal yyue to hem the lond, and thei schulen welde it.
Sotheli turne ye ayen, and go ye in to the wildirnesse, bi the weie of the Reed See.
And ye answeriden to me, We synneden to the Lord; we schulen stie, and we schulen fiyte, as oure Lord God comaundide. And whanne ye weren arayed with armeris, and yeden `into the hil, the Lord seide to me,
Seie thou to hem, `Nyle ye stye, nether fiyte ye, for Y am not with you, lest ye fallen bifor youre enemyes.
Y spak, and ye herden not; but ye `weren aduersaries to the comaundement of the Lord, and bolnden with prijde, and stieden in to the hil.
Therfor Ammorrey yede out, that dwellide in the hillis, and he cam ayens you, and pursuede you, as bees ben wont to pursue, and killide fro Seir til Horma. And whanne ye turneden ayen,
and wepten bifor the Lord, he herde not you, nether wolde asente to youre vois;
therfor ye saten in Cades Barne bi myche tyme.
And we yeden forth fro thennus, and camen in to the wildirnesse that ledith to the Reed See, as the Lord seide to me; and we cumpassiden the hil of Seir in long tyme.
And the Lord seide to me, It sufficith to you to cumpasse this hil;
go ye ayens the north.
And comaunde thou to the puple, and seie, Ye schulen passe bi the termes of youre britheren, the sones of Esau, that dwellen in Seir, and thei schulen drede you.
Therfor se ye diligentli, that ye be not moued ayens hem; for Y schal not yyue to you of the land `of hem as myche as the steppe of o foot may trede, for Y yaf the hil of Seir in to the possessioun of Esau.
Ye schulden bie of hem metis for money, and ye schulen ete; ye schulden drawe, and drynke watir bouyt.
Thi Lord God blesside thee in al the werk of thin hondis; he knewe thi weye, hou thou passidist this moste wildirnesse, bi fourti yeer; and thi Lord God dwellide with thee, and no thing failide to thee.
And whanne we hadden passid bi oure britheren, the sones of Esau, that dwelliden in Seir, bi the weie of the feeld of Elath, and of Asiongaber, we camen to the weie that ledith in to deseert of Moab.
And the Lord seide to me, Fiyte thou not ayens Moabitis, nether bigyn thou batel ayens hem, for Y schal not yyue to thee ony thing of the lond `of hem, for Y yaf Ar in to possessioun to `the sones of Loth.
Emyn, `that is, griseful men, weren first dwelleris therof, a greet puple, and strong, and so hiy, that thei weren bileued as giantis,
of the generacioun of Enachym, and thei weren lijk the sones of Enachym; forsothe Moabitis clepen hem Emyn.
Forsothe Horreis dwelliden bifore in Seir, and whanne thei weren put out, and weren doon awey, `the sones of Esau dwelliden there, as Israel dide in the lond of his possessioun, which the Lord yaf to hym.
Therfor we riseden, that we schulden passe the stronde of Zared, and camen to it.
Sotheli the tyme in whiche we yeden fro Cades Barne `til to the passynge of the stronde of Zared, was of eiyte and thretti yeer, til al the generacioun of `men fiyteris was wastid fro `the castels, as the Lord hadde swore; whos hond was ayens hem,
that thei schulden perische fro the myddis of `the castels.
Forsothe after that alle the fiyteris felden doun,
the Lord spak to me, and seide,
Thou schalt passe to dai the termes of Moab,
the cytee, Ar bi name, and thou schalt neiy in the nyy coost of the sones of Amon; be thou war that thou fiyte not ayens hem, nether be moued to batel; for Y schal not yyue to thee of the lond of the sones of Amon, for Y yaf it to the `sones of Loth in to possessioun.
It is arettid the lond of giauntis, and giauntis enhabitiden therynne sumtyme, whiche giauntis Amonytis clepen Zonym;
a myche puple and greet, and of noble lengthe, as Enachym, whiche the Lord dide awey fro the face of hem,
and made hem to dwelle for `tho giauntis, as he dide to the sones of Esau, that dwellen in Seire, `and dide awai Horreis, and yaf to hem the lond `of Horreis, which `the sones of Esau welden `til in to present tyme.
Also men of Capadocie puttiden out Eueys, that dwelliden in Asseryn, `til to Gaza; which yeden out fro Capadocie, and diden awey Eueis, and dwelliden for hem.
Rise ye, and `passe ye the stronde of Arnon; lo! Y haue bitake in `thin hond Seon, king of Esebon, of Amorreis; and his lond bigynne thou `to welde, and smyte thou batel ayens him.
To dai Y schal bigynne to sende thi drede and strengthe in to puplis that dwellen vndir al heuene, that whanne thi name is herd, thei drede, and tremble bi the maner of wymmen trauelynge of child, and `be holdun with sorewe.
Therfor Y sente messangeris fro the wildirnesse of Cademoch to Seon, kyng of Esebon; and Y seide with pesible wordis,
We schulen passe thorou thi lond, we schulen go in the comyn weie; we schulen not bowe nether to the riyt side, nether to the left side.
Sille thow metis `to vs for prijs, that we ete; yif thow watir for money, and so we schulen drynke. Oneli it is that thou graunte passage to vs,
as the sones of Esau diden, that dwellen in Seir, and as Moabitis diden, that dwellen in Ar, til we comen to Jordan, and passen to the lond which oure Lord God schal yyue to vs.
And Seon, kyng of Esebon, nolde yyue passage `to vs; for thi Lord God made hard his spirit, and made sad in yuel `the herte of hym, that he schulde be bitakun in to thin hondis, as thou seest now.
And the Lord seide to me, Lo, Y bigan to bitake to thee Seon, and his lond; bigynne thou to welde it.
And Seon yede out ayens vs with al his puple to batel in Jasa.
And oure Lord God bitook hym to vs, and we han smyte hym with hise sones, and al his puple.
And we token in that tyme alle the citees, whanne the dwelleris of tho citees, men, and wymmen, and children weren slayn; we leften not in hem ony thing,
outakun beestis that camen in to the part of men takynge prey, and outakun spuylis of the cytees whiche we tokun.
Fro Aroer, which is on the brenke of the stronde of Arnon, fro the toun which is set in the valey, `til to Galaad, no town was ether citee, that ascapide oure hondis.
Oure Lord God bitook alle to vs; outakun the lond of the sones of Amon, to which lond we neiyiden not, and outakun alle thingis that liggen to the stronde of Jeboth, and outakun the citees of the munteyns, and alle places fro whiche oure Lord God forbeed vs.
And so we turneden, and stieden bi the weie of Basan; and Og, the kyng of Basan, yede out ayens vs with his puple, to fiyte in Edrai.
And the Lord seide to me, Drede thou not hym, for he is bitakun in thin hond, with al his puple, and his lond; and thou schalt do to hym, as thou didist to Seon, kyng of Ammoreis, that dwellide in Esebon.
Therfor oure Lord God bitook in oure hondis also Og, kyng of Basan, and al his puple; and we han smyte hym `til to deeth,
and wastiden alle the citees `of him in o tyme; no town was that ascapide vs; `we destrieden sixti citees, al the cuntrei of Argob, of the rewme of Og in Basan.
Alle the citees weren strengthid with hiyest wallis, and with yatis and barris; with out townes vnnoumbrable, that hadden not wallis.
And we diden awey thilke men, as we diden to Seon, kyng of Esebon; and we losten ech citee, and men, and wymmen, and litle children;
forsothe we token bi prey beestis, and the spuylis of citees.
And we token in that tyme the lond fro the hond of twey kyngis of Ammorreis, that weren biyonde Jordan, fro the stronde of Arnon `til to the hil of Hermon,
`which hil Sidonyes clepen Sarion, and Ammorreis clepen Sanyr.
We tooken alle the citees that weren set in the pleyn, and al the lond of Galaad, and of Basan, `til to Selcha and Edray, citees of the rewme of Og, in Basan.
For Og aloone, kyng of Basan, was left of the generacioun of giauntis; and his yrun bed is schewid, which is in Rabath, of the sones of Amon, and hath nyne cubitis of lengthe, and foure cubitis of breede, at the mesure of a cubit of mannus hond.
And we weldiden in that tyme the lond, fro Aroer, which is on the `brynke of the stronde of Arnon, `til to the myddil paart of the hil of Galaad; and Y yaf the citees `of hym to Ruben and Gad.
Forsothe Y yaf the tother part of Galaad, and al Basan, of the rewme of Og, to the half lynage of Manasses, and al the cuntrei of Argob. Al Basan was clepid the lond of giauntis.
Jair, `sone of Manasses, weldide al the cuntrey of Argob, `til to the lond of Gesuri and of Machati; and he clepide bi his name Basan Anothiair, that is, the townes of Jair, til in to present dai.
Also Y yaf Galaad to Machir; and to the lynagis of Ruben and of Gad Y yaf the lond of Galaad, `til to the strond of Arnon, the myddil of the stronde,
and of the endis `til to the stronde of Jeboth, which is the terme of `the sones of Amon.
And Y yaf the pleyn of the wildernesse `til to Jordan, and the termes of Cenereth `til to the see of deseert, which see is moost salt, at the rotis of the hil of Phasga, ayens the eest.
And Y comaundide to you in that tyme, and seide, Youre Lord God yyueth to you this lond in to erytage;
alle ye stronge men, without wyues and litle children and beestis, be maad redi, and `go ye bifor youre brithren, the sones of Israel. For Y knowe that ye han many beestis, and tho schulen dwelle in citees whiche Y yaf to you,
til the Lord yyue reste to youre brithren, as he yaf to you, and til thei also welden the lond `which the Lord schal yyue to hem biyonde Jordan; thanne ech man schal turne ayen in to his possessioun which Y yaf to you.
Also Y comaundid to Josue in that tyme, and seide, Thin iyen sien what thingis youre Lord God dide to these twei kyngis; so he schal do to alle rewmes, to whiche thou schalt go; drede thou not hem.
And Y preiede the Lord in that tyme,
and seide, Lord God, thou hast bigunne to schewe to thi seruaunt thi greetnesse, and strongeste hond,
for noon other God is ether in heuene, ether in erthe, that mai do thi werkis, and may be comparisound to thi strengthe.
Therfor Y schal passe, and schal se this beeste lond biyende Jordan, and this noble hil and Liban.
And the Lord was wrooth to me for you, nethir he herde me, but seide to me, It suffisith to thee; speke thou no more of this thing to me.
`Stye thou in to the hiynesse of Phasga, and caste aboute thin iyen to the west, and north, and south, and eest, and biholde, for thou schalt not passe this Jordan.
Comaunde thou to Josue, and strengthe thou and coumforte hym; for he schal go bifore this puple, and he schal departe to hem the lond, which thou schalt se.
And we dwelliden in the valey ayens the temple of Phegor.
And now, thou Israel, here the comaundementis and domes whiche Y teche thee, that thou do tho, and lyue, and that thow entre and welde the lond which the Lord God of youre fadris schal yyue to you.
Ye schulen not adde to the word which Y speke to you, nether ye schulen take awei `fro it; kepe ye the comaundementis of youre Lord God, which Y comaunde to you.
Youre iyen sien alle thingis whiche the Lord dide ayens Belphegor; how he alto brak alle the worschiperis `of hym fro the myddis of you.
Forsothe ye that cleuen to youre Lord God lyuen alle `til in to present day.
Ye witen that Y tauyte you the comaundementis and riytfulnessis, as my Lord God comaundide to me; so ye schulen do tho in the lond whiche ye schulen welde,
and ye schulen kepe, and schulen fille in werk. For this is youre wisdom and vndurstondyng bifor puplis, that alle men here these comaundementis, and seie, Lo! a wise puple and vnderstondynge! a greet folk!
Noon other nacioun is so greet, `not in noumbre ether in bodili quantite, but in dignite, that hath Goddis neiyynge to it silf, as oure God is redi to alle oure bisechyngis.
For whi what other folk is so noble, that it hath cerymonyes and iust domes, and al the lawe which Y schal `sette forth to dai bifor youre iyen?
Therfor kepe thi silf, and thi soule bisili; foryete thou not the wordis whiche thin iyen sien, and falle tho not doun fro thin herte, in alle the daies of thi lijf. Thou schalt teche tho thi sones and thi sones sones.
Telle thou the day in which thou stodist bifor thi Lord God in Oreb, whanne the Lord spak to me, and seide, Gadere thou the puple to me, that it here my wordis, and lerne for to drede me in al tyme in which it lyueth in erthe, and teche hise sones.
And ye neiyiden to the `roote of the hille, that brente `til to heuene; and derknessis, and cloude, and myist weren therynne.
And the Lord spak to you fro the myddis of fier; ye herden the vois of hise wordis, and outirli ye sien no fourme.
And he schewide to you his couenaunt, which he comaundide, that ye schulden do, and `he schewide ten wordis, whiche he wroot in two tablis of stoon.
And he comaundide to me in that tyme, that Y schulde teche you cerymonyes and domes, whiche ye owen to do in the lond whiche ye schulen welde.
Therfor kepe ye bisili youre soulis; ye sien not ony licnesse in the dai in which the Lord spak to you in Oreb, fro the myddis of the fier;
lest perauenture ye be disseyued and make to you a grauun licnesse, ether an ymage of male, ether of female;
a licnesse of alle beestis that ben on erthe, ether of bridis fleynge vndur heuene,
and of crepynge beestis that ben moued in erthe, ether of fischis that dwellen vndur the erthe in watris; lest perauenture,
whanne thin iyen ben reisid to heuene, thou se the sonne, and moone, and alle the sterris of heuene, and be disseyued bi errour, and worschipe tho, `bi outermer reuerence, and onour, `bi ynner reuerence, `tho thingis whiche thi Lord God made of nouyt, in to seruyce to alle folkis that ben vndur heuene.
Forsothe the Lord took you, and ledde out of the yrun furneys of Egipt, that he schulde haue a puple of eritage, as it is in `present dai.
And the Lord was wrooth ayens me for youre wordis, and swoor that Y schulde not passe Jordan, and schulde not entre in to the beeste lond, which he schal yyue to you.
Lo! Y die in this erthe; Y schal not passe Jordan; ye schulen passe, and schulen welde the noble lond.
Be thou war, lest ony tyme thou foryete the couenaunt of thi Lord God, which he made with thee, and lest thou make to thee a grauun licness of tho thingis whiche the Lord forbeed to make.
For thi Lord God is fier wastynge ; `God, a feruent louyere.
If ye gendren sones, and sones of sones, and ye dwellen in the lond, and ye be disceyued, and make to you ony licnesse, and doen yuel bifor youre Lord God, that ye terren hym to greet wrathe,
Y clepe witnesses to dai heuene and erthe, `that is, ech resonable creature beynge in heuene and in erthe, that ye schulen perische soone fro the lond, which ye schulen welde, whanne ye han passid Jordan; ye schulen not dwelle long tyme therynne, but the Lord schal do awey you,
and schal scatere `in to alle hethen men, and ye schulen leeue fewe among naciouns, to whiche the Lord schal lede you.
And there ye schulen serue to goddis, that ben maad bi `the hond of men, to a tre and a stoon, that `seen not, nether heren, nether eten, nether smellen.
And whanne thou hast souyt there thi Lord God, thou schalt fynde hym; if netheles thou sekist with al the herte, and with al the tribulacioun of thi soule.
Aftir that alle thingis han founde thee, that ben biforseid, forsothe in the laste tyme, thou schalt turne ayen to thi Lord God, and thou schalt here his vois.
For thi Lord God is merciful God; he schal not forsake thee, nethir he schal do awey outirli, nethir he schal foryete the couenaunt, in which he swoor to thi fadris.
Axe thou of elde daies that weren bifor thee, fro the day in which thi Lord God made of nouyt man on erthe, axe thou fro that oon ende of heuene `til to the tother ende therof, if sich a thing was doon ony tyme, ether if it was euere knowun,
that a puple herde the vois of God spekynge fro the myddis of the fier, as thou herdist, and siest;
if God `dide, that he entride, and took to him silf a folc fro the middis of naciouns, bi temptaciouns, myraclis, and grete wondris, bi batel, and strong hond, and arm holdun forth, and orrible siytis, bi alle thingis whiche youre Lord God dide for you in Egipt, `while thin iyen sien;
that thou schuldist wite, that the Lord hym silf is God, and noon other is, outakun oon.
Fro heuene he made thee to here his vois, that he schulde teche thee; and in erthe he schewide to thee his grettiste fier, and thou herdist the wordis `of hym fro the myddis of the fier;
for he louyde thi fadris, and chees her seed aftir hem. And he ledde thee out of Egipt, and yede bifore in his greet vertu,
that he schulde do awei grettiste naciouns, and strongere than thou, in thin entryng, and that he schulde lede thee ynne, and schulde yyue to thee the lond `of hem in to possessioun, as thou seest in `present day.
Therfor wite thou to dai, and thenke in thin herte, that the Lord him silfe is God in heuene aboue, and in erthe bynethe, and noon other is.
Kepe thou hise heestis, and comaundementis, whiche Y comaunde to thee, that it be wel to thee, and to thi sones after thee, and that thou dwelle mych tyme on the lond, which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
Thanne Moises departide thre citees biyende Jordan at the eest coost,
that he fle to tho, that sleeth his neighbore not wilfuli, and was not enemy bifore oon and `the tother dai, and that he mai fle to summe of these citees;
Bosor in the wildirnesse, which is set in the feeldi lond, of the lynage of Ruben; and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the lynage of Gad; and Golan in Basan, which is in the lynage of Manasses.
This is the lawe which Moises `settide forth bifor the sones of Israel,
and these ben the witnessyngis, and cerymonyes, and domes, whiche he spak to the sones of Israel, whanne thei yeden out of Egipt,
biyende Jordan, in the valey ayens the temple of Phegor, in the lond of Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, that dwellide in Esebon, whom Moises killide. And the sones of Israel yeden out of Egipt, and weldiden `the lond of him,
and the lond of Og, kyng of Basan, twei kyngis of Ammoreis, that weren biyende Jordan, at the rysyng of the sunne;
fro Aroer which is set on the brenke of the stronde of Arnon, `til to the hil of Seon, which is Hermon;
thei weldiden al the pleyn biyende Jordan, at the eest coost, `til to the see of wildirnesse, and `til to the rootis of the hil of Phasga.
And Moises clepide al Israel, and seide to hym, Here, thou Israel, the cerymonyes and domes, whiche Y speke to dai in youre eeris; lerne ye tho, and `fille ye in werk.
Oure Lord God made a boond of pees with vs in Oreb;
he made not couenaunt, `that is, of lawe writun, with oure fadris, but with vs that ben present, and lyuen.
Face to face he spak to vs in the hil, fro the myddis of the fier.
Y was recouncelere and mediatour bitwixe God and you in that tyme, that Y schulde telle to you the wordis `of hym, for ye dredden the fier, and `stieden not in to the hil. And `the Lord seide,
Y am thi Lord God, that ladde thee out of the lond of Egipt, fro the hows of seruage.
Thou schalt not haue alien Goddis in my siyt.
Thou schalt not make to thee a grauun ymage, nether a licnesse of alle thingis that ben in heuene aboue, and that ben in erthe bynethe, and that lyuen in watris vndur erthe;
thou schalt not herie tho, `and thou schalt not worschipe tho; for Y am thi Lord God, `God a feruent louyer; and Y yelde the wickidnesse of fadris, in to sones in to the thridde and the fourthe generacioun to hem that haten me,
and Y do mersy in to many thousyndis to hem that louen me, and kepen myn heestis.
Thou schalt not mystake the name of thi Lord God in veyn, for he schal not be vnpunyschid, that takith the name of God on a veyn thing.
Kepe thou the `day of sabat that thou halewe it, as thi Lord God comaundide to thee.
In sixe daies thou schalt worche, and thou schalt do alle thi werkis;
the seventhe day is `of sabat, that is the reste of thi Lord God. Thou schalt not do therynne ony thing of werk ; thou, and thi sone, and douyter, seruaunt, and handmaide, and oxe, and asse, and `al thi werk beeste, and the pilgrym which is with ynne thi yatis; that thi seruaunt reste and thin handmaide, as also thou.
Bithenke thou, that also thou seruedist in Egipt, and thi Lord God ledde thee out fro thennus, in a strong hond, and arm holdun forth; therfor he comaundide to thee, that thou schuldist kepe the `dai of sabat.
Onoure thi fadir and thi modir, as thi Lord God comaundide to thee, that thou lyue in long tyme, and that it be wel to thee, in the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
Thou schalt not sle.
Thou schalt not do letcherie.
And thou schalt not do thefte.
Thou schalt not speke fals witnessyng ayens thi neiybore.
Thou schalt not coueite `the wijf of thi neiybore, not hows, not feeld, not seruaunt, not handmayde, not oxe, not asse, and alle thingis that ben hise.
The Lord spak these wordis to al youre multitude, in the hil, fro the myddis of fier and of cloude and of myist, with greet vois, and addide no thing more; and he wroot tho wordis in two tablis of stoon, whiche he yaf to me.
Forsothe after that ye herden the vois fro the myddis of the derknessis, and sien the hil brenne, alle ye princis of lynagis, and the grettere men in birthe, neiyiden to me, and seiden, Lo!
oure Lord God schewide to vs his maieste and greetnesse; we herden his vois fro the myddis of fier, and we preueden to day that a man lyuede, `while God spak with man.
Whi therfor schulen we die, and schal this gretteste fier deuoure vs? For if we heren more the vois of oure Lord God, we schulen die.
What is ech man, that he here the vois of God lyuynge, that spekith fro the myddis of fier, as we herden, and that he may lyue?
Rathere neiye thou, and here thou alle thingis whiche oure Lord God schal seie to thee; and thou schalt speke to vs, and we schulen here, and schulen do tho wordis.
And whanne the Lord hadde herd this, he seide to me, Y herde the vois of the wordis of this puple, whiche thei spaken to thee; thei spaken wel alle thingis.
Who schal yyue `that thei haue siche soule, that thei drede me, and kepe alle my comaundementis in al tyme, that it be wel to hem and to the sones `of hem, with outen ende?
Go thou, and seye to hem, Turne ye ayen in to youre tentis.
Sotheli stonde thou here with me, and Y schal speke to thee alle comaundementis, and cerymonyes, and domes, whiche thou schalt teche hem, that thei do tho in the lond which Y schal yyue to hem in to possessioun.
Therfor kepe ye, and `do ye tho thingis, whiche the Lord God comaundide to you; ye schulen not bowe awey, nether to the riyt side nether to the left side,
but ye schulen go bi the weie whiche youre Lord God comaundide, that ye lyue, and that it be wel to you, and that youre daies be lengthid in the lond of youre possessioun.
These ben the comaundementis, and cerymonyes, and domes, whiche youre Lord God comaundide that Y schulde teche you, and that ye do tho in the lond to which ye passen ouer to welde;
that thou drede thi Lord God, and kepe alle hise comaundementis, and heestis, whiche Y comaunde to thee, and to thi sones, and sones of sones, in alle the daies of thi lijf, that thi daies be lengthid.
Thou Israel, here, and kepe, that thou do tho thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to thee, and that it be wel to thee, and thou be multiplied more, as the Lord God of thi fadris bihiyte, to yyue to thee a lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
Thou Israel, here, thi Lord God is o God.
Thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of al thi strengthe.
And these wordis whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai, schulen be in thin herte;
and thou schalt telle tho to thi sones, and thou schalt thenke on tho, sittynge in thin hows, and goynge in the weie, slepynge, and rysinge.
And thou schalt bynde tho as a signe in thin hond; and tho schulen be, and schulen be moued bifor thin iyen; and thou schalt write tho in the lyntel,
and in the doris of thin hows.
And whanne thi Lord God hath brouyt thee in to the lond, for which he swoor to thi fadris, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and hath youe to thee grete citees, and beeste, whiche thou bildidist not,
housis fulle of alle richessis, whiche thou madist not, and cisternes, which thou diggedist not, `places of vynes, and `places of olyues, whiche thou plauntidist not,
and thou hast ete, and art fillid,
be war diligentli, lest thou foryete the Lord, that ladde thee out of the lond of Egipt, fro the hows of seruage. Thou schalt drede thi Lord God, and thou schalt serue hym aloone, `bi seruyce due to God onely, and thou schalt swere bi his name.
Ye schulen not go aftir alien goddis, of alle hethen men that ben `in youre cumpas;
for God is a feruent louyere, thi Lord God is in the myddis of thee, lest ony tyme the `strong veniaunce of thi Lord God be wrooth ayens thee, and do awei thee fro `the face of the erthe.
Thou schalt not tempte thi Lord God, as thou temptidist in the place of temptyng.
Kepe thou the comaundementis of thi Lord God, and the witnessyngis, and cerymonyes, whiche he comaundide to thee;
and do thou that that is plesaunt and good in the siyt of the Lord, that it be wel to thee, and that thou entre, and welde the beste lond, of which the Lord swoor to thi fadris,
that he schulde do awey alle thin enemyes bifor thee, as he spak.
And whanne thi sone schal axe thee to morewe, that is, in tyme comyng, and schal seie, What wolen these witnessyngis, and cerymonyes, and domes to hem silf, whiche oure Lord God comaundide to vs?
thou schalt seie to hym, We weren `seruauntis of Farao in Egipt, and the Lord ledde vs out of Egipt, in strong hond;
and he dide myraclis, and grete wondris, and werste, `that is, moost peyneful veniaunces, in Egipt, ayens Farao and al his hows, in oure siyt.
And he ledde vs out therof, that he schulde yyue to vs led yn, the lond of which he swoor to oure fadris.
And the Lord comaundide to vs, that we do alle these lawful thingis, and drede oure Lord God, that it be wel to vs in alle the daies of oure lijf, as it is to dai.
And he schal be merciful to vs, if we schulen do and kepe alle hise heestis, bifor oure Lord God, as he comaundide to vs.
Whanne thi Lord God hath lad thee in to the lond, in to which thou schalt entre to welde, and hath do awey many folkis bifor thee, Ethei, and Gergesei, and Ammorrey, Canenei, and Pherezei, Euey, and Jebusei; seuene folkis, of myche gretter noumbre than thou art, and strengere than thou;
and thi Lord God hath bitake hem to thee, thou schalt smyte hem `til to deeth, thou schalt not make `with hem a boond of pees, nether thou schalt haue merci on hem,
nether thou schalt felowschipe mariagis with him; thou schalt not yyue thi douyter to the sone `of hym, nether thou schalt take his douytir to thi sone;
for sche schal disceyue thi sone, that he sue not me, and that he serue more alien goddis; and the strong veniaunce of the Lord schal be wrooth, and schal do awei thee soone.
But rather thou schalt do these thingis to hem; destrie ye the auteris `of hem, and breke ye ymagis `of metal, and kitte ye doun wodis, and brenne ye grauun ymagis.
For thou art an hooli puple to thi Lord God; thi Lord God chees thee, that thou be a special puple to hym, of alle puplis that ben on erthe.
Not for ye ouercamen in noumbre alle folkis, the Lord is ioyned to you, and chees yow, sithen ye ben fewere than alle puplis;
but for the Lord louede you, and kepte the ooth which he swoor to youre fadris; and he ledde you out in strong hond, and ayen bouyte you fro the hows of seruage, fro `the hows of Farao, kyng of Egipt.
And thou schalt wite, that thi Lord God hym silf is a strong God, and feithful, and kepith couenaunt and mersi to hem that louen hym, and to hem that kepen hise comaundementis, in to a thousynde generaciouns;
and yeldith anoon to hem that haten hym, so that he destrie hem, and differr no lengere; restorynge anoon to hem that that thei disseruen.
Therfor kepe thou the comaundementis, and cerymonyes, and domes, whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai, that thou do.
If aftir that thou herist these domes, thou kepist, and doist tho, thi Lord God schal kepe to thee couenaunt, and mersi, which he swoor to thi fadris.
And he schal loue thee, and schal multiplie thee, and he schal blesse the fruyt of thi wombe, and the fruyt of thi lond, thi wheete, and vindage, oile, and droues of beestis, and the flockis of thi scheep, on the lond for which he swoor to thi fadris, that he schulde yyue it to thee.
Thou schalt be blessid among alle puplis; noon bareyn of euer eithir kynde schal be at thee, as well in men, as in thi flockis.
The Lord schal do awei fro thee all ache, `ether sorewe; and he schal not brynge to thee the worste siknessis of Egipt, whiche thou knewist, but to alle thin enemyes.
And thou schalt `deuoure, that is, distrie, alle puplis, whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee; thin iye schal not spare hem, nethir thou schalt serue the goddis `of hem, lest thei ben in to the fallyng of thee.
If thou seist in thin herte, These folkis ben mo than Y, hou may Y do awei hem?
`nyle thou drede, but haue thou mynde, what thingis thi Lord God dide to Farao, and alle Egipcians;
`he dide the gretteste veniaunces, whiche thin iyen sien, and miraclis and grete wondris, and the strong hond, and arm `holdun forth, that thi Lord God schulde lede thee out; so he schal do to alle puplis whiche thou dredist.
Ferthermore and thi Lord God schal sende venemouse flies in to hem, til he do awei, and destrye alle men, that fledden thee, and thei schulen not mowe be hid.
Thou schalt not drede hem, for thi Lord is in the myddis of thee, grete God, and ferdful.
He hym silf schal waste these naciouns in thi siyt, litil and litil, and bi partis; thou schalt not mow do awey `tho naciouns togidere, lest peraventure beestis of erthe be multiplied ayens thee;
and thi Lord God schal yyue hem in thi siyt, and he schal sle hem, til thei be doon awey outerly.
And he schal bitake the kyngis `of hem in to thin hondis, and thou schalt destrie the names `of hem vndur heuene; noon schal mow ayenstonde thee, til thou al to-breke hem.
Thou schalt brenne in fier the grauun ymagis `of hem; thou schalt not coueite the siluer and gold, of whiche tho ymagis ben maad, nether thou schalt take of tho ony thing to thee, lest thou offende therfor, for it is abhominacioun of thi Lord God.
Nether thou schalt brynge ony thing of the idol in to thin hous, lest thou be maad cursid, as also that idol is; thou schalt wlate it as filthe, and thou schalt haue it as defoulyng, and filthis of abhomynacioun, for it is cursid.
Be thou war diligentli, that thou do ech comaundement which Y comaunde to thee to dai, that ye moun lyue, and be multiplied, and that ye entre, and welde the lond, for which the Lord swoor to youre fadris.
And thou schalt haue mynde of al the weie, bi which thi Lord God ledde thee by fourti yeer, bi deseert, that he schulde turmente, and schulde tempte thee; and that tho thingis that weren tretid in `thi soule schulden be knowun, whether thou woldist kepe hise comaundementis, ethir nay.
And he turmentide thee with nedynesse, and he yaf to thee meete, manna which thou knewist not, and thi fadris `knewen not, that he schulde schewe to thee, that a man lyueth not in breed aloone, but in ech word that cometh `out of the Lordis mouth, `that is, bi manna, that cam down `at the heest of the Lord.
Thi cloth, bi which thou were hilid, failide not for eldnesse, and thi foot was not brokun undernethe, lo!
the fourtith yeer is; that thou thenke in thin herte, for as a man techith his sone,
so thi Lord God tauyte thee, that thou kepe the comaundementis of thi Lord God, and go in hise weies, and drede hym.
For thi Lord God schal lede thee in to a good lond, in to the lond of ryueris, and of `stondynge watris, and of wellis, in whos feeldis and mounteyns the depthis of floodis breken out;
in to the lond of wheete, of barli, and of vyneris, in which lond fige trees, and pumgranadis, and `olyue trees comen forth; in to the lond of oile, and of hony;
where thow schalt ete thi breed with out nedynesse, and schalt vse the aboundaunce of alle thingis; of which lond the stonys ben yrun, and metals of tyn ben diggid of the hillis therof;
that whanne thou hast ete, and art fillid, thou blesse thi Lord God for the beste lond which he yaf to thee.
Therfor kepe thou, and be war, lest ony tyme thou foryete thi Lord God, and dispise hise comaundementis, and domes, and cerymonyes, whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai;
lest aftir that thou hast ete, and art fillid, hast bildid faire housis, and hast dwellid in tho,
and hast droues of oxun, and flockis of scheep, and plente of siluer, and of gold, and of alle thingis, thine herte be reisid,
and thenke not on thi Lord God, that ledde thee out of the lond of Egipt, and fro the hous of seruage,
and was thi ledere in the greet wildirnesse and ferdful, in which was a serpent brenninge with blast, and scorpioun, and dipsas, and outirli no `watris; which Lord ledde out stremes of the hardeste stoon,
and fedde thee with manna in the wildirnesse, which manna thi fadris knewen not. And after that the Lord turmentid thee, and preuede, at the last he hadd mersi on thee,
lest thou woldist seie in thin herte, My strengthe, and the myyt of myn hond yaf alle these thingis to me.
But thenke thou on thi Lord God, that he yaf strengthis to thee, that he schulde fille his couenaunt, of whiche he swoor to thi fadris, as present dai schewith.
Forsothe if thou foryetist thi Lord God, and suest aliene goddis, and worschipist hem `in herte, and onourist `with outforth, lo! now Y biforseie to thee, that thou schalt perische outerli;
as hethen men perischiden, whiche the Lord dide awei in thin entryng, so and ye schulen perische, if ye schulen be vnobedient to the vois of youre Lord God.
Here thou, Israel; thou schalt passe Jordan to dai, that thou welde mooste naciouns, and strengere than thou; grete citees, and wallid `til to heuene;
a greet puple, and hiy; the sones of Enachym, whiche thi silf `siest, and herdist, whiche no man may ayenstonde in the contrarie part.
Therfor thou schalt wite to dai, that thi Lord God hym silf schal passe bifor thee; he is a fier deuourynge and wastynge, that schal al to breke hem, and schal do awei, and destrie bifor thi face swiftli, as he spak to thee.
Seie thou not in thin herte, whanne thi Lord God hath do hem awey in thi siyt, For my riytfulnesse the Lord brouyte me yn, that Y schulde welde this lond; sithen these naciouns ben doon awey for her wickidnessis.
For not for thi riytfulnessis, and equyte of thin herte thou schalt entre that thou welde the lond `of hem; but for thei diden wickidli, thei weren doon awey, whanne thou entridist, and that the Lord schulde fille his word which he bihiyte vndur an ooth to thi fadris, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Therfor wite thou that not for thi riytfulnesses thi Lord God yaf to thee this beste lond in to possessioun, sithen thou art a puple of hardeste nol.
Haue thou mynde, and foryete not, hou in the wildirnesse thou terridist thi Lord God to greet wraththe; fro that dai in which thou yedist out of Egipt `til to this place, thou striuedist euere ayens the Lord.
For whi also in Oreb thou terridist hym, and he was wrooth, and wolde do thee awei, whanne Y stiede in to the hil,
that Y schulde take two tablis of stoon, the tablis of couenaunt which the Lord made with you, and Y continuede in the hil fourti daies and nyytis, and Y eet not breed, and Y drank not watir.
And the Lord yaf to me, twey tablis of stoon, euer either wrytun with Goddis fyngur, and conteynynge alle the wordis whiche he spak to you in the hil, fro the myddis of the fier, whanne the cumpany of puple was gaderid togidere.
And whanne fourti daies and so many nyytis hadden passid, the Lord yaf to me twei tablis of stoon, tablis of boond of pees;
and he seide to me, Rise thou, and go doun for hennys soone, for thi puple, which thou leddist out of Egipt, han forsake swiftli the weie which thou schewidist to hem, and thei han maad to hem a yotun calf.
And eft the Lord seide to me, `Y se that this puple is of hard nol;
suffre thou me, that I alto breke hym, and do awey the name `of hym fro vndur heuene; and Y schal ordeyne thee on a folk which is grettere and strongere than this folk.
And whanne Y cam doun fro the hil brennynge, and helde with euer either hond twei tablis of boond of pees, and Y seiy,
that ye hadde synned to youre Lord God, and hadden maad to you a yotun calf, and hadden forsake swiftli the weie of God which he schewide to you,
Y castide doun the tablis fro myn hondis, and brak tho tablis in youre siyt.
And Y felde doun bifor the Lord as `biforto, in fourti daies and fourti nyytis, and Y eet not breed, `and drank not watir, for alle youre synnes whiche ye diden ayens the Lord, and terriden hym to `greet wraththe;
for Y dredde the indignacioun and yre of hym, by which he was stirid ayens you, and wolde do you awey. And the Lord herde me also in this tyme.
Also the Lord was wrooth greteli ayens Aaron, and wolde alto breke hym, and Y preiede in lijk maner for hym.
`Forsothe Y took youre synne which ye maden, that is, the calf, and brente it in fier, and Y alto brak in gobetis, and droof outerli in to dust, and castide forth in to the stronde, that cam doun fro the hil.
Also in the brennyng, and in the temptacioun at the watris of ayenseiyng, and in the Sepulcris of Coueytise, ye terriden the Lord;
and whanne Y sente you fro Cades Barne, and seide, `Stye ye, and welde the lond which Y yaf to you, and ye dispisiden the comaundement of youre Lord God, and ye bileueden not to him, nether ye wolden here his vois;
but euere ye weren rebel, fro the day in which Y bigan to knowe you.
And Y lay byfore the Lord fourti daies and fourti nyytis, in whiche Y bisouyte hym mekeli, that he schulde not `do awey you, as he manaasside.
And Y preiede, and seide, Lord God, distrye not thi puple, and thin eritage, which thou `ayen bouytist in thi greetnesse, which thou leddist out of Egipt in strong hond.
Haue thou mynde of thi seruauntis, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; biholde thou not the hardnesse of this puple, and the wickidnesse, and the synne therof,
lest perauenture the dwelleris of the lond, out of which thou leddist vs, seien, The Lord myyte not bryng hem in to the lond which he bihiyte to hem, and he hatide hem; therfor he ledde hem out that he schulde sle hem in wildirnesse;
and thei ben thi puple and thin eritage, which thou leddist out in thi greet strengthe, and in thin arm holdun forth.
In that tyme the Lord seide to me, Hewe thou twei tablis of stoon to thee, as the formere weren; and stie thou to me `in to the hil. And thou schalt make an arke,
`ether a cofere, of tree, and Y schal write in the tablis, the wordis that weren in these tablis whiche thou brakist bifore; and thou schalt putte tho tablis in to the arke.
Therfor Y made an ark of the trees of Sechim, and whanne Y hadde hewe twei tablis of stoon, at the licnesse of the formere tablis, Y stiede in to the hil, and hadde the tablis in the hondis.
And he wroot in the tablis, bi that that he `hadde writun bifore, ten wordis, whiche the Lord spak to you in the hil, fro the myddis of the fyer, whanne the puple was gaderid, and he yaf the tablis to me.
And Y turnide ayen fro the hil, and cam doun, and puttide the tablis in to the arke which Y hadde maad, `whiche tablis ben there hidur to, as the Lord comaundide to me.
Forsothe the sones of Israel moueden tentis fro Beroth of the sones of Jachan in to Mosera, where Aaron was deed, and biried, for whom his sone Eleazar was set in preesthod.
Fro thennus thei camen in to Galgad; fro which place thei yeden forth, and settiden tentis in Jehabatha, in the lond of watris and of strondis.
In that tyme Y departide the lynage of Leuy, that it schulde bere the arke of boond of pees of the Lord, and schulde stonde bifor hym in seruyce, and schulde blesse in his name til in to present dai.
For which thing Leuy hadde not part, nether possession with hise brithren, for the Lord hym silf is his possessioun, as thi Lord God bihiyte to hym.
Forsothe Y stood in the hil as bifore, fourti daies and fourti niytis, and the Lord herde me also in this tyme, and nolde leese thee.
And he seide to me, Go thou, and go bifor this puple, that it entre, and welde the lond which Y swoor to her fadris, that Y schulde yeue to hem.
And now, Israel, what axith thi Lord God of thee, no but that thou drede thi Lord, and go in hise weies, and that thou loue hym, and serue thi Lord God in al thin herte, and in al thi soule;
and that thou kepe the comaundementis of thi Lord God, and the cerymonyes of hym, whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai, that it be wel to thee.
Lo! heuene is of thi Lord God, and heuene of heuene; the erthe and alle thingis that ben ther ynne ben hise;
and netheles the Lord was glued to thi fadris, and louede hem, and he chees her seed after hem, and you of alle folkis, as it is preued to dai.
Therfor circumcide ye the prepucie, `ethir vnclennesse, of youre herte, and no more make ye harde youre nol.
For youre Lord God hym silf is God of goddis, and Lord of lordis, `God greet, and miyti, and feerdful, which takith not persoone, nether yiftis.
He makith doom to the fadirles, and modirles, and to the widewe; he loueth a pilgrym, and yyueth to hym lyiflode and clothing.
And therfor `loue ye pilgryms, for also ye weren comelyngis in the lond of Egipt.
Thou schalt drede thi Lord God, and thou schalt serue hym aloone, and thou schalt cleue to hym, and thou schalt swere in his name.
He is thi preisyng, and thi God, that made to thee these grete dedis, and ferdful, whiche thin iyen siyen.
In seuenti men thi fadris yeden doun in to Egipt, and lo! now thi Lord God hath multiplied thee as the sterris of heuene.
Therfor loue thi Lord God, and kepe thou hise comaundementis and cerymonyes, domes and heestis, in al tyme.
Knowe ye to day tho thingis whiche youre sones knowen not, `whiche sones sien not the doctryn of youre Lord God, hise grete dedis, and strong hond, and `arm holdun forth,
myraclis and werkis, whiche he dide `in the myddis of Egipt to Farao, kyng, and to al `the lond of hym, and to al the oost of Egipcians,
and to horsis, and carris; hou the watris of the reed see hiliden hem, whanne thei pursueden you, and the Lord `dide awei hem `til in to `present dai;
and whiche thingis the Lord dide to you in wildernesse, til ye camen to this place;
and to Dathan and Abiron, `the sones of Heliab, that was `the sone of Ruben, whiche the erthe swolewide, whanne his mouth was openyd, with `the housis and tabernaclis, and al the catel `of hem which thei hadden, in the myddis of Israel.
Youre iyen sien alle the grete werkis of the Lord,
whiche he dide, that ye kepe alle hise heestis whiche Y comaunde to dai to you, and that ye moun entre, and welde the lond,
to which ye schulen entre, and ye lyue therynne in myche time; which lond, flowynge with mylk and hony, the Lord bihiyte vndur an ooth to youre fadris and to `the seed of hem.
For the lond, to which thou schalt entre to welde, is not as the lond of Egipt, `out of which thou yedist, where whanne the seed is cast in the maner of gardyns, moist waters ben led;
but it is hilli, and feldi, and abidith reynes fro heuene,
which lond thi Lord God biholdith, and hise iyen ben therynne, fro the bigynnyng of the yeer `til to the ende therof.
Therfor if ye schulen obeie to myn heestis whiche Y comaunde to dai to you, that ye loue youre Lord God, and serue hym in al youre herte, and in al youre soule;
he schal yyue to youre lond reyn tymeful and late, that ye gadere wheete, and wyn, and oile,
hey of the feeldis to feede beestis, that ye bothe ete and be fillid.
Be ye war, lest perauenture youre herte be disseyued, and ye go awei fro the Lord, and serue alien goddis, and worschipe hem;
and the Lord be wrooth, and close heuene, and reynes come not doun, nether the erthe yyue his fruyt, and ye perische swiftli fro the beste lond which the Lord schal yyue to you.
Putte ye thes wordis in youre hertes and soules, and honge ye `tho wordis for a signe in the hondis, and sette ye bitwixe youre iyen.
Teche youre sones, that thei thenke on tho wordis, whanne thou sittist in thin hows, and goist in the weie, and lyggist doun, and risist.
Thou schalt write tho wordis on the postis, and yatis of thin hous,
that the daies of thee and of thi sones be multiplied in the lond which the Lord swoor to thi fadris, that he schulde yyue to hem, as long as heuene is aboue erthe.
For if ye kepen the heestis whiche Y comaunde to you, and ye do tho, that ye loue youre Lord God, and go in alle hise weies,
and cleue to hym, the Lord schal destrie alle these hethen men bifor youre face, and ye schulen welde tho folkis that ben grettere and strongere than ye.
Ech place which youre foot schal trede, schal be youre; fro the deseert, and fro the Liban, and fro the greet flood Eufrates `til to the west see, schulen be youre termes.
Noon schal stonde ayens you; youre Lord God schal yiue youre outward drede and inward drede on ech lond which ye schulen trede, as he spak to you.
Lo! Y sette forth in youre siyt to day blissyng and cursyng;
blessyng, if ye obeien to the heestis of youre Lord God, whiche Y comaunde to you to dai;
cursyng, if ye heren not the heestis of youre Lord God, but goen awei fro the weie which Y schewe now to you, and goen after alien goddis whiche ye knowen not.
Sotheli whanne thi Lord God hath brouyt thee in to the lond, to which to enhabite thou goist, thou schalt sette blessyng on the hil Garisym, cursyng on the hil Hebal, whiche hillis ben biyende Jordan,
aftir the weie that goith to the goyng doun of the sunne, in the lond of Cananey, that dwellith in the feeldi places ayens Galgala, which is bisidis the valey goynge and entrynge fer.
For ye schulen passe Jordan, that ye welde the lond which youre Lord God schal yyue to you, and that ye haue and welde that lond.
Therfor se ye, `that ye fille the cerymonyes and domes, whiche I schal sette to dai in youre siyt.
These ben the heestis and domes, whiche ye owen to do, in the lond which the Lord God of thi fadrys schal yyue to thee, that thou welde it, in alle daies in whiche thou schalt go on erthe.
Distrie ye alle the places wherynne hethen men whiche ye schulen welde, worschipiden her goddis, on hiy mounteyns, and litle hillis, and vndur ech tre ful of bowis.
Distrie ye `the auteris of hem, and `breke ye the ymagis; brenne ye the wodis with fier, and al to breke ye the idolis; destrie ye `the names of hem fro the places.
Ye schulen not do so to youre Lord God ;
but ye schulen come to the place which youre Lord God chees of alle youre lynagis, that he putte his name there, and dwelle therynne;
and ye schulen come, and schulen offre in that place youre brent sacrifices, and slayn sacrifices, the dymes, and firste fruytis of youre hondis, and avowis and yiftis, the firste gendrid thingis of oxun, and of scheep.
And ye and youre housis schulen ete there in the siyt of youre Lord God; and ye schulen be glad in alle thingis to whiche ye putten hond, in whiche youre Lord God blesside you.
Ye schulen not do there tho thingis whiche we don here to dai, ech man that semeth riytful to `hym silf.
For `til in to present tyme ye camen not to reste and possessioun, which the Lord God schal yyue to you.
Ye schulen passe Jordan, and ye schulen dwelle in the lond which youre Lord God schal yyue to you, that ye reste fro alle enemyes `bi cumpas, and dwelle without ony drede.
In the place which youre Lord God chees that his name be therynne. Thidur ye schulen bere alle thingis, whiche Y comaunde, brent sacrifices, and sacrifices, and the dymes, and firste fruytis of youre hondis, and what euere is the beste in yiftis, whiche ye auowiden to the Lord.
Ther ye schulen ete bifor youre Lord God, ye, and youre sones and douytris, youre seruauntis, and seruauntessis, and the dekenes, that dwellen in youre citees; for thei han not other part and possessioun among you.
Be thou war lest thou offre thi brent sacrifices in ech place which thou seest,
but in that place which the Lord chees in oon of thi lynagis thou schalt offre sacrifices, and schalt do what euer thingis Y comaunde to thee.
Forsothe if thou wolt ete, and the etyng of fleischis delitith thee, sle thou, and ete, bi the blessyng of thi Lord God, which he yaf to thee in thi citees, whether it is vnclene, `that is, spottid ether wemmed and feble, ether clene, `that is, hool in membris and with out wem, which is leueful to be offrid, thou schalt ete as a capret and hert; oneli without etyng of blood,
which thou schalt schede out as watir on the erthe.
Thou schalt not mowe ete in thi citees the tithis of thi wheete, wyn, and oile, the firste gendrid thingis of droues, and of scheep, and alle thingis whiche thou hast avowid and wolt offre bi fre wille, and the firste fruytis of thin hondis;
but thou schalt ete tho bifor thi Lord God, in the place which thi Lord God chees, thou, and thi sone, and douyter, seruaunt, and seruauntesse, and the dekene that dwellith in thi citees; and thou schalt be glad, and schalt be fillid bifor thi Lord God in alle thingis to whiche thou holdist forth thin hond.
Be thou war lest thou forsake the dekene in al tyme, `in which thou lyuest in erthe.
Whanne thi Lord God hath alargid thi termes, as he spak to thee, and thou wolt ete fleischis, whiche thi soule desirith,
forsothe if the place is fer, which thi Lord God chees, that his name be there, thou schalt sle of thin oxun, and scheep, whiche thou hast, as `the Lord comaundide to thee; and thou schalt ete in thi citees as it plesith thee.
As a capret and hert is etun, so thou schalt ete tho; bothe a cleene man and vncleene schulen ete therof in comyn.
Oneli eschewe thou this, that thou ete not blood; for the blood `of tho beestis is for the lijf, and therfor thou owist not ete the lijf with fleischis,
but thou schalt schede as watir `the blood on the erthe,
that it be wel to thee, and to thi sones after thee, whanne thou hast do that, that plesith in the siyt of the Lord.
Sotheli thou schalt take that that thou `auowidist, and halewidist to the Lord, and thou schalt come to the place which the Lord chees;
and thou schalt offre thin offryngis, fleischis, and blood, on the auter of thi Lord God; thou schalt schede in the auter the blood of sacrifices; forsothe thou schalt ete the fleischis.
Kepe thou and here alle thingis whiche Y comaunde to thee, that it be wel to thee, and to thi sones after thee, with outen ende, whanne thou hast do that, that is good and plesaunt in the siyt of thi Lord God.
Whanne thi Lord God hath distryed bifor thi face folkis, to whiche thou schalt entre to welde, and thou hast weldid tho folkis, and hast dwellid in `the lond of hem,
be thou war lest thou sue hem, aftir that thei ben distried, whanne thou entrist, and thou seke `the cerymonyes of hem, and seie, As these folkis worschipyden her goddis, so and Y schal worschipe.
Thou schalt not do in lijk manere to thi Lord God; for thei diden to her goddis alle abhomynaciouns whiche the Lord wlatith, and offriden her sones and douytris, and brenten with fier.
Do thou to the Lord this thing oneli which Y comaunde to thee, nethir adde thou ony thing, nether abate.
If a prophete risith in the myddis of thee, ethir he that seith hym silf to haue seyn a dreem, and he biforseith a signe and a wondur to comynge aftir,
and this that he spak bifallith, and he seith to thee, Go we, and sue alien goddis, whiche thou knowist not, and serue we hem,
thou schalt not here the wordis of that prophete, ether of dremere; for youre Lord God assaieth you, that he wite opynli whether ye louen hym ether nay, in al youre herte, and in al youre soule.
Sue ye youre Lord, and `drede ye hym; kepe ye his comaundementis, and here ye `the vois of hym; ye schulen serue hym, and ye schulen cleue to hym.
Forsothe thilke prophete, ether the feynere of dremes, schal be slayn ; for he spak that he schulde turne you awei fro youre Lord God, that ladde you out of the lond of Egipt, and ayenbouyte you fro the hous of seruage, that `thilke prophete schulde make thee to erre fro the weie which thi Lord God comaundide to thee; and thou schalt do awey yuel fro the myddis of thee.
If thi brothir, the sone of thi modir, ether thi sone, ethir thi douyter, ether the wijf which is in thi bosum, ethir thi freend whom thou louest as thi soule, wole counsele thee, and seith priueli, Go we and serue alien goddis, whiche thou knowist not,
and thi fadris, of alle the folkis `in cumpas, that ben niy ether fer, fro the bigynnyng `til to the ende of the lond,
assente thou not to hym, nether here thou, nether thin iyen spare hym, that thou haue mercy,
and hide hym, but anoon thou schalt sle hym. Thin hond be fyrst on him and aftir thee al the puple putte to hond.
He schal be oppressid with stoonus, and `schal be slayn; for he wolde drawe thee awei fro thi Lord God, that ledde thee out of the lond of Egipt, fro the hous of seruage,
that al Israel here and drede, and do no more ony thing lijk this thing.
If thou herist ony men seiynge in oon of thi citees, whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee to enhabite,
The sones of Belial yeden out fro the myddis of thee, and turneden awei the dwelleris of the citee, and seiden, Go we, and serue alien goddis whiche ye knowen not,
enquere thou bisili, and whanne the treuthe of the thing is biholdun diligentli, if thou fyndist that this thing is certeyn, which is seid, and that this abhominacioun is doon in werk,
anoon thou schalt smyte the dwelleris of that citee bi the scharpnesse of swerd, and thou schalt `do it awey, and alle thingis that ben ther ynne, `til to beestis.
Also what euer thing of purtenaunce of houshold is, thou schalt gadere in the myddis of the stretis therof, and thou schalt brenne with that citee, so that thou waste alle thingis to thi Lord God, and it be a biriel euerlastynge; it schal no more be bildid.
And no thing of that cursyng schal cleue in thin hond, that the Lord be turned awei fro the yre of his strong veniaunce, and haue mercy on thee, and multiplie thee, as he swoor to thi fadris.
Whanne thou hast herd the vois of thi Lord God, thou schalt kepe alle hise heestis whiche Y comaunde to thee to day, that thou do that that is plesaunt in the siyt of thi Lord God.
Be ye the sones of youre Lord God; ye schulen not kitte you, nether ye schulen make ballidnesse,
on a deed man, for thou art an hooli puple to thi Lord God, and he chees thee that thou be to hym in to a special puple, of alle folkis that ben on erthe.
Ete ye not tho thingis that ben vncleene.
This is a beeste which ye schulen ete; an oxe, and a scheep, and a goet, an hert,
a capret, a `wielde oxe, tregelafun, `that is, a beeste in parti lijk `a buk of geet, and in parti liik an hert, a figarde, an ostrich, a camelioun, `that is, a beeste lijk in the heed to a camel, and hath white spottis in the bodi as a parde, and `is lijk an hors in the necke, and in the feet is lijc a `wilde oxe, and a parde.
Ye schulen ete ech beeste that departith the clee `in to twei partis, and chewith code.
Sotheli ye schulen not ete these beestis, of these that chewen code, and departen not the clee; a camel, an hare, and a cirogrille, `that is, a beeste ful of prickis, and is more than an irchoun; for tho chewen code, and departen not the clee, tho schulen be vncleene to you;
also a swyn, for it departith the clee, and chewith not code, schal be vncleene; ye schulen not ete the fleischis of tho, and ye schulen not touche the deed bodies.
Ye schulen ete these thingis, of alle that dwellen in watris; ete ye tho thingis that han fynnes and scalis;
ete ye not tho thingis that ben with out fynnes and scalis, for tho ben vncleene.
Ete ye alle clene briddis;
ete ye not vncleene briddis, that is, an egle, and a gripe,
and an aliete, ixon, `that is, a whijt brid lesse than a vultur, and is of the `kynde of vultris, and a vultur, and a kite bi his kynde,
and al thing of rauenys kynde,
and a strucioun, and a nyyt crowe, and a lare,
and an hauk bi his kynde, a fawcun,
and a swan, and a siconye, and a dippere, a pursirioun, and a reremous, a cormeraunt,
and a caladrie, alle in her kynde; also a lapwynke and a backe.
And al thing that crepith, and hath fynnes, schal be vncleene, and schal not be etun.
Ete ye al thing that is cleene; sotheli what euer thing is deed bi it silf, ete ye not therof.
Yyue thou to the pilgrym which is with ynne thi yatis, that he ete, ether sille thou to hym, for thou art the hooli puple of thi Lord God. Thou schalt not sethe a kyde in `the mylk of his modir.
Thou schalt departe the tenthe part of alle thi fruytis that comen forth in the lond bi ech yeer;
and thou schal ete in the siyt of thi Lord God, in the place which he chees, that his name be clepid therynne; thou schalt offre the tithe of thi wheete, wyn, and oile, and the firste gendryd thingis of thi droues, and scheep, that thou lerne to drede thi Lord God in al tyme.
Sotheli whanne the wei is lengere, and the place which thi Lord God chees is fer, and he hath blessid thee, and thou maist not bere alle these thingis to that place,
thou schalt sille alle thingis, and schalt turne in to prijs, and thou schalt bere in thin hond, and thou schalt go to the place which thi Lord God chees;
and thou schalt bie of the same money what euer thing plesith to thee, ethir of droues, ether of scheep; also thou schalt bie wyn, and sidur, and al thing that thi soule desirith; and thou schalt ete bifor thi Lord God, and thou schalt make feeste,
thou, and thin hows, and the dekene which is withynne thi yatis; be thou war lest thou forsake hym, for he hath not other part in possessioun.
In the thridde yeer thou schalt departe another dyme of alle thingis that growen to thee in that yeer, and thou schalt kepe withynne thi yatis.
And the dekene schal come, whych hath noon other part nether possessioun with thee, and the pilgrym, and the fadirles, ether modirles child, and widue, that ben withynne thi yatis, `schulen come, and schulen ete, and be fillid, that thi Lord God blesse thee, in alle werkis of thin hondis whiche thou schalt do.
In the seuenthe yeer thou schalt make remyssioun,
that schal be fillid bi this ordre. To whom ony thing is `dettid, ethir owid of his freend, ether neiybore, and brother, he schal not mowe axe, for it is the yeer of remyssioun of the Lord.
Thou schalt axe of a pilgrym and comelyng; thou hast not power to axe of a citeseyn and neiybore;
and outerli a nedi man and begger schal not be among you, that thi Lord God blesse thee, in the lond which he schal yyue to thee in to the possessioun.
If netheles thou schalt here the vois of thi Lord God, and schalt kepe alle thingis whiche he comaundide, and whiche Y comaunde to dai to thee, he schal blesse thee, as he bihiyte.
Thou schalt leene to many folkis, and thou schalt not take borewyng of ony man; thou schalt be lord of ful many naciouns, and no man schal be lord of thee.
If oon of thi britheren that dwellen with ynne the yatis of thi citee, in the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, cometh to pouert, thou schalt not make hard thin herte, nether thou schalt `drawe to gydere the hond,
but thou schalt opene it to the pore man, and thou schalt `yyue loone to which thou siest hym haue nede.
Be thou war lest perauenture wickid thouyt crepe priueli to thee, and thou seie in thin herte, The seuenthe yeer of remyssioun neiyeth; and thou turne awey the iyen fro thi pore brother, and thou nyle yyue to hym the loone that he axith; lest he crie ayens thee to the Lord, and it be maad to thee in to synne.
But thou schalt yyue to hym, and thou schalt `not do ony thing falsly in releuynge `hise nedis, that thi Lord God blesse thee in al tyme, and in alle thingis to whiche thou schalt sette to hond.
Pore men schulen not faile in the lond of `thin habitacioun; therfor Y comaunde to thee, that thou opene the hond to thi brother nedi and pore, that lyuen with thee in the lond.
Whanne thi brothir an Ebrew man, ethir an Ebrew womman, is seeld to thee, and hath serued thee sixe yeer, in the seuenthe yeer thou schalt delyuere hym fre.
And thou schalt not suffre hym go awey voide, to whom thou hast yyue fredom;
but thou schalt yyue lijflode in the weye, of flockis, and of cornfloor, and of thi pressour, in whiche thi Lord God hath blessid thee.
Haue thou mynde that also thou seruedist in the lond of Egipt, and thi Lord God delyurede thee, `ether made thee free, and therfor Y comaunde now to thee.
Forsothe if `the seruaunt seith, Y nyle go out, for he loueth thee, and thin hows, and feelith that it is wel to hym at thee, thou schalt take `a nal,
and thou schalt peerse his eere in the yate of thin hous, and he schal serue thee til in to the world, `that is til to the iubilee, ethir fiftithe yeer; also thou schalt do in lijk maner to the handmayde.
Thou schalt not turne awei fro hem thin iyen, whanne thou schalt delyure hem fre, for bi the hire of an hirid man thei serueden thee bi sixe yeer; that thi Lord God blesse thee, in alle the werkis whiche thou doist.
Of the first gendrid thingis that ben borun in thi droues, and scheep, what euer is of male kynde, thou schalt halewe to thi Lord God. Thou schalt not worche in the firste gendrid thing `of oxe, and thou schalt not clippe the firste gendrid thinges of scheep.
Thou schalt ete tho bi alle yeeris in the siyt of thi Lord God, thou, and thin hows, in the place `which the Lord chees.
Sotheli if it hath a wem, ethir is crokid, ethir is blynd, ethir is foul, ethir feble in ony part, it schal not be offrid to thi Lord God;
but thou schalt ete it with ynne the yatis of thi citee, bothe a cleene man and vncleene schulen ete tho in lijk maner, as a capret and an hert.
Onely thou schalt kepe this, that thou ete not the blood of tho, but schede out as watir in to erthe.
Kepe thou the monethe of newe fruytis, and of the bigynnyng of somer, that thou make pask to thi Lord God; for in this monethe thi Lord God ledde thee out of Egipt in the nyyt.
And thou schalt offre pask to thi Lord God, of scheep and of oxun, in the place which thi Lord God chees, that his name dwelle there.
Thou schalt not ete `ther ynne breed `diyt with sourdouy; in seuene daies thou schalt ete breed of affliccioun, with out sourdouy, for in drede thou yedist out of Egipt, that thou haue mynde of the dai of thi goyng out of Egipt, in alle the daies of thi lijf.
No thing `diyt with sourdouy schal appere in alle thi termes by seuene daies, and of the fleischis of that that is offrid in the euentid, schal not dwelle in the firste dai in the morewtid.
Thou schalt not mow offre pask in ech of thi citees whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee,
but in the place which thi Lord God chees, that his name dwelle there; thou schalt offre pask in the euentid, at the goyng doun of the sunne, whanne thou yedist out of Egipt.
And thou schalt sethe, and ete, in the place which thi Lord God hath chose, and thou schalt rise in the morewtid of the secunde dai, and thou schalt go in to thi tabernaclis.
Bi sixe daies thou schalt ete therf breed; and in the seuenthe dai, for it is the gaderyng of thi Lord God, thou schalt not do werk.
Thou schalt noumbre to thee seuene woukis, fro that dai in which thou settidist a sikil in to the corn;
and thou schalt halewe the feeste dai of woukis to thi Lord God, a wilful offryng of thyn hond, which thou schalt offre by the blessing of thi Lord God.
And thou schalt ete bifore thi Lord God, thou, and thi sone, and thi douytir, and thi seruaunt, and thin handmayde, and the dekene which is with ynne thi yatis, and the comelynge, and the fadirles ethir modirles child, and the widue, that dwellen with you, in the place `which thi Lord God chees that his name dwelle there.
And thou schalt haue mynde for thou were seruaunt in Egipt, and thou schalt kepe and do tho thingis that ben comaundid.
And thou schalt halewe the solempnytee of tabernaclis bi seuene daies, whanne thou hast gaderid thi fruytis of the cornfloor, and pressour.
And thou schalt ete in thi feeste dai, thou, and thi sone, and douytir, and thi seruaunt, and handmayde, also the dekene, and comelyng, and the fadirles ether modirles child, and the widewe, that ben with ynne thi yatis, `schulen ete.
Bi seuene daies thou schalt halewe feestis to thi Lord God, in the place which the Lord chees; and thi Lord God schal blesse thee, in alle thi fruytis, and in al the werk of thin hondis, and thou schalt be in gladnesse.
In thre tymes bi the yeer al thi male kynde schal appere in the siyt of thi Lord, in the place which he chees, in the solempnyte of therf looues, and in the solempnyte of woukis, and in the solempnyte of tabernaclis. A man schal not appere voide bifor the Lord;
but ech man schal offre vpe this that he hath, bi the blessyng of his Lord God, which he yaf to `that man.
Thou schalt ordeyne `iugis, and maystris, in alle thi yatis whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, bi ech of thi lynagis, that thei deme the puple bi iust doom,
and bowe not in `to the tother part for fauour, ethir yifte `ayens equete. Thou schalt not take persoone nether yiftis, for whi yiftis blynden the iyen of wise men, `and chaungen the wordis of iust men.
Thou schalt pursue iustli that that is iust, that thou lyue and welde the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
Thou schalt not plaunte a wode, and ech tre bi the auter of thi Lord God;
nether thou schalt make to thee, and ordeyne an ymage; whiche thingis thi Lord God hatith.
Thou schalt not offre to thi Lord God an oxe and a scheep in which is a wem, ether ony thing of vice, for it is abhominacioun to thi Lord God.
And whanne a man ether a womman, that doon yuel in the siyte of thi Lord God, ben foundun at thee, with ynne oon of thi yatis whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, and thei breken the couenaunt of God,
that thei go and serue alien goddis, and worschipe hem, the sunne, and moone, and al the knyythod of heuene, whiche thingis Y comaundide not;
and this is teld to thee, and thou herist, and `enquerist diligentli, and fyndist that it is soth, and abhomynacioun is doon in Israel;
thou schalt lede out the man and the womman, that diden a moost cursid thing, to the yatis of thy citee, and thei schulen be oppressid with stoonus.
He that schal be slayn, schal perische in the mouth of tweyne, ethir of thre witnessis; no man be slayn, for o man seith witnessyng ayens hym.
The hond of witnessis schal first sle hym, and the last hond of the tothir puple schal be sent, that thou do awei yuel fro the myddis of thee.
If thou perseyuest, that hard and douteful doom is at thee, bitwixe blood and blood, cause and cause, lepre and not lepre, and thou seest that the wordis of iugis with ynne thi yatis ben dyuerse; rise thou, and stie to the place which thi Lord God hath choose;
and thou schalt come to the preestis of the kyn of Leuy, and to the iuge which is in that tyme, and thou schalt axe of hem, whiche schulen schewe to thee the treuthe of doom.
And thou schalt do, what euer thing thei seien, that ben souereyns in the place which the Lord chees, and techen thee bi the lawe of the Lord;
thou schalt sue the sentence of hem; thou schalt not bowe to the riyt side, ether to the lefte.
Forsothe that man schal die, which is proud, and nyle obeie to the comaundement of the preest, `that mynystrith in that tyme to thi Lord God, and to the sentence of iuge, and thou schalt do awei yuel fro the myddis of Israel;
and al the puple schal here, and drede, that no man fro thennus forth bolne with pride.
Whanne thou hast entrid in to the lond, which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, and weldist it, and dwellist therynne, and seist, Y schal ordeyne a kyng on me, as alle naciouns `bi cumpas han;
thou schalt ordeyne hym, whom thi Lord God chesith of the noumbre of thi brethren. Thou schalt not mow make king a man of anothir folk, which man is not thi brother.
And whanne the king is ordeyned, he schal not multiplie horsis to hym, nethir he schal lede ayen the puple in to Egipt, nethir he schal be reisid bi the noumbre of knyytis, moost sithen the Lord comaundide to you, that ye turne no more ayen bi the same weie.
The kyng schal not haue ful many wyues, that drawen his soule `to ouer myche fleischlynesse, nether `he schal haue grete burthuns of siluer and of gold.
Forsothe after that he hath sete in the trone of his rewme, he schal write to himsilf the deuteronomy of this lawe in a `volym ether book, and he schal take `a saumpler at preestis of `the kyn of Leuy;
and he schal haue it with hym, and he schal rede it in alle the daies of his lijf, that he lerne to drede his Lord God, and to kepe hise wordis and cerymonyes, that ben comaundid in the lawe;
nether his herte be reisid in to pride on hise brithren, nether bowe he in to the riyt side, ether left side, that he regne long tyme, he and hise sones on Israel.
Preestis and dekenes, and alle men that ben of the same lynage, schulen `not haue part and eritage with the tother puple of Israel, for thei schulen ete the sacrifices of the Lord, and the offryngis of hym;
and thei schulen not take ony othir thing of the possessioun of her britheren; for the Lord hym silf is the `eritage of hem, as he spak to hem.
This schal be the doom of preestis of the puple, and of hem that offren sacrifices; whether `thei offren an oxe, ether a scheep, thei schulen yyue to the preest the schuldre, and the paunche, the firste fruytis of wheete,
and of wyn, and of oile, and a part of wollis of the scheryng of scheep.
For thi Lord God chees hym of alle thi lynagis, that he stonde and mynystre to `the name of the Lord, he and hise sones, with outen ende.
If a dekene goith out of oon of thi citees of al Israel, in which he dwellith, `and wole come and desirith the place which the Lord chees,
he schal mynystre in the name of his Lord God as alle hise britheren dekenes, that schulen stonde in that tyme byfore the Lord.
He schal take the same part of meetis, `which and othere dekenes schulen take; outakun that that is due to hym in his citee, bi `successioun ethir eritage `of fadir.
Whanne thou hast entrid in to the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, be thou war lest thou wole sue abhomynaciouns of tho folkis;
noon be foundun in thee that clensith his sone, ether his douytir, `and ledith bi the fier, ethir that axith questiouns of dyuynouris `that dyuynen aboute the auteris, and that taketh hede to dremes and chiteryng of bryddis; nethir ony wicche be,
nethir an enchauntere, `that is, that disseyueth mennus iyen that a thing seme that is not; nether a man take counsel at hem that han a feend spekynge `in the wombe, nether take counsel at false dyuynouris nethir seke of deed men the treuthe.
For the Lord hath abhomynacioun of alle these thingis, and for siche wickidnessis he schal do awei hem in thin entryng.
Thou schalt be perfit and without filthe, with thi Lord God.
These hethen men, `the lond of whiche thou schalt welde, heren hem that worchen bi chiteryng of briddis, and false dyuynouris; forsothe thou art tauyt in other maner of thi Lord God.
Thi Lord God schal reise a prophete of thi folk and of thi britheren as me, thou schalt here hym;
as thou axidist of thi Lord God in Oreb, whanne the cumpany was gaderid, and thou seidist, Y schal no more here the vois of my Lord God, and Y schal no more se `this grettiste fier, lest Y die.
And the Lord seide to me, Thei spaken wel alle thingis.
Y schal reise to hem a prophete, lijk thee, of the myddis of her britheren, and Y schal putte my wordis in his mouth, and he schal speke to hem alle thingis, whiche I schal comaunde to him.
Forsothe Y schal be vengere of `that man, that nyle here the wordis `of hym, whiche he schal speke in my name.
`Sotheli a prophete `schal be slayn, which is bischrewid with pride, and wole speke in my name tho thingis, whiche Y comaundide not to hym, that he schulde seie, ethir bi the name of alien goddis.
That if thou answerist bi pryuy thouyt, Hou may Y vndirstonde the word, which the Lord spak not? thou schalt haue this signe,
`The Lord spak not this thing which thilke prophete biforseid in the name of the Lord, `and it bifallith not, but `the prophete feynede bi the pride of his soule, and therfor thou schalt not drede hym.
Whanne thi Lord God hath distried the folkis, whose lond he schal yyue to thee, and thou hast weldid it, and hast dwellid in the citees and housis therof;
thou schalt departe thre citees to thee `in the myddis of the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee into possessioun.
Thou schalt make redi diligentli the weye, and thou schalt departe euenly in to thre partis al the prouynce of thi lond, that he that is exilid for mansleyng, haue `of nyy whidur he may ascape.
This schal be the lawe of a mansleere fleynge, whos lijf schal be kept. If a man smytith vnwityngli his neiybore, and which is preuyd to haue not had ony hatered ayens hym yistirdai and the thridde dai agoon,
but to haue go sympli with hym in to the wode to hewe doun trees, and in the fellyng doun of trees the axe fleeth fro the hond, and the yrun slidith fro the helue, and smytith, and sleeth his freend; this man schal flee to oon of the forseid citees, and schal lyue;
lest perauenture the next kynesman of hym, whos blood is sched out, be prickid with sorewe, and `pursue, and take hym, if the weie is lengere, and smyte `the lijf of hym which is not gilti of deeth; for it is schewid that he hadde not ony hatered bifore ayens hym that is slayn.
Therfor Y comaunde to thee, that thou departe thre citees of euene space bitwixe hem silf.
Forsothe whanne thi Lord God hath alargid thi termes, as he swoor to thi fadris, and hath youe to thee al the lond which he bihiyte to hem; if netheles thou kepist hise comaundementis,
and doist tho thingis whiche Y comaunde to thee to day, that thou loue thi Lord God, and go in hise weies in al tyme, thou schalt adde to thee thre othere citees, and thou schalt double the noumbre of the forseid citees,
that gilteles blood be not sched out in the myddis of the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee to haue in possessioun, lest thou be gilti of blood.
Forsothe if ony man hatith his neiybore, and settith aspies, `ether tresouns, to his lijf, and risith, and smytith him, and he is deed, and he fleeth to oon of the forseid citees,
the eldere men of that citee schulen sende, and `thei schulen take hym fro the place of refuyt; and thei schulen bitake hym in to the hond of the nexte kynesman of hym, whos blood is sched out,
and he schal die, and thou schalt not haue mercy on hym; and thou schalt do awey gilti blood fro Israel, that it be wel to thee.
Thou schalt not take, and turne ouer the termes of thi neiybore, which the formere men settiden in thi possessioun, which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee in the lond, `which lond thou schalt take `to be weldid.
O witnesse schal not stonde ayens ony man, what euer thing it is of synne and of wickidnesse; but ech word schal stonde in the mouth of tweyne ethir of thre witnessis.
If a fals witnesse stondith ayens a man, and accusith hym of brekyng of the lawe, bothe,
of whiche the cause is, schulen stonde bifor the Lord, in the siyt of preestis, and of iugis, that ben in tho daies.
And whanne thei sekynge moost diligentli han founde that the fals witnesse seide a leesyng ayens his brothir,
thei schulen yelde to hym, as he thouyte to do to his brother; and thou schalt do awey yuel fro the myddis of thee, that othere men here,
and haue drede, and be no more hardi to do siche thingis.
Thou schalt not haue mercy on hym, but thou schalt axe lijf for lijf, iye for iye, tooth for tooth, hond for hond, foot for foot.
If thou goist out to batel ayens thin enemyes, and seest multitude of knyytis, and charis, and grettere multitude of the aduersarie oost than thou hast, thou schalt not drede hem; for thi Lord God is with thee, that ledde thee out of the lond of Egipt.
Sotheli whanne the batel neiyeth now, the preest schal stonde bifor the scheltrun, and thus he schal speke to the puple,
Thou, Israel, here to dai, ye han batel ayens youre enemyes; youre herte drede not, `nyle ye drede; nyle ye yyue stede, drede ye not hem;
for youre Lord God is in the myddis of you, and he schal fiyte for you ayens aduersaries, that he delyuere you fro perel.
`Also the duykis schulen crie bi alle cumpanyes, `while the oost schal here, Who is a man that bildide a newe hows, and halewide not it? go he and turne ayen into his hows, lest perauenture he die in batel, and another man halewe it.
Who is a man that plauntide a vyner, and not yit made it to be comyn, and of which it is leeueful to alle men to ete? go he, and turne ayen in to his hows, lest perauenture he die in batel, and anothir man be set in his office.
Who is a man that spowside a wijf, and `took not hir `bi fleischli knowyng? go he, and turne ayen in to his hows, lest perauenture he die in batel, and anothir man take hir.
Whanne these thingis ben seid, thei schulen adde othere thingis, and schulen speke to the peple, Who is a ferdful man, and of gastful herte? go he, and turne ayen in to his hows, lest he make `the hertis of his britheren for to drede, as he is agast bi drede.
And whanne the duykis of the oost ben stille, and han maad ende of speking, ech `of the princis and cheuenteyns of the oost schal make redie his cumpeneyes to batel.
If ony tyme thou schalt go to a citee to ouercome it, first thou schalt profire pees to it.
If the citee resseyueth, and openeth to thee the yatis, al the puple that is ther ynne schal be saued, and schal serue thee vndur tribut.
Sotheli if they nylen make boond of pees, and bigynnen batel ayens thee, thou schalt fiyte ayens it.
And whanne thi Lord God hath bitake it in thin hond, thou schalt smyte bi the scharpnesse of swerd al thing of male kynde which is ther ynne,
with out wymmen, and yonge children, beestis and othere thingis that ben in the citee. Thou schalt departe al the prey to the oost, and thou schalt ete of the spuylis of thin enemyes, whiche spuylis thi Lord God yaf to thee.
Thus thou schalt do to alle the citees, that ben ful fer fro thee, and ben not of these citees which thou schalt take in to possessioun.
Sotheli of these citees that schulen be youun to thee, thou schalt not suffre eny to lyue,
but thou schalt sle bi the scharpnesse of swerd; that is to seie, Ethei, and Ammorrey, and Cananei, Ferezei, Euey, and Jebusei, as `thi Lord God comaundide to thee;
lest perauenture thei techen you to do alle abhomynaciouns, whiche thei wrouyten to her goddis, and ye doon synne ayens youre Lord God.
Whanne thou hast bisegid a citee `in myche tyme, and hast cumpassid with strengthingis that thou ouercome it, thou schalt not kitte doun trees, of whiche `me may ete, nether thou schalt waste the cuntrey `bi cumpas with axis; for it is `a tree, and not man, nether it may encresse the noumbre of fiyteris ayens thee.
Forsothe if onye ben not appil trees, but `of the feeld, and ben able in to othere vsis, kitte doun, and make thou engynes, til thou take the citee that fiytith ayens thee.
Whanne the careyn of a man slayn is foundun in the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, and `the gilti of sleyng is vnknowun,
the grettere men in birthe and thi iugis schulen go out, and schulen mete fro the place of the careyn the spaces of alle citees `bi cumpas;
and the eldre men of that citee, `which thei seen to be neer than othere, schulen take of the droue a cow calf, that `drow not yok, nether kittide the erthe with a schar;
and thei schulen lede that cow calf to a scharp `valey, and ful of stoonys, that was neuere erid, nether resseyuede seed; and in that valey thei schulen kitte the heed of the cow calf.
And the preestis, the sones of Leuy, schulen neiye, whiche thi Lord God chees, that thei mynystre to hym, and blesse in his name, and al the cause hange at `the word of hem; and what euer thing is cleene ethir vncleene, be demed.
And the grettere men in birthe of that citee schulen come to the slayn man, and thei schulen waische her hondis on the cow calf, that was slayn in the valei;
and thei schulen seie, Oure hondis schedden not out this blood, nether oure iyen sien.
Lord, be mercyful to thi puple Israel, whom thou `ayen brouytist, and arette thou not innocent blood in the myddis of thi puple Israel. And the gilt of blood schal be don awey fro hem.
Forsothe thou schalt be alien fro the blood of the innocent which is sched, whanne thou hast do that that the Lord comaundide.
If thou goist out to batel ayens thin enemyes, that thi Lord God bitakith hem in thin hond, and thou ledist prisoneris,
and thou seest in the noumbre of prisounneris a fair womman, and thou louest hir, and wole haue hir to wijf,
thou schalt brynge hir in to thin hows; `which womman schal schaue the heer, and schal kitte the nailes aboute, and sche schal putte awei the clooth,
wher ynne sche was takun, and sche schal sitte in thin hows, and schal biwepe hir fadir and modir o monethe; and aftirward thou schalt entre to hir, and schalt sleepe with hir, and sche schal be thi wijf.
But if aftirward sche sittith not in thi soule, `that is, plesith not thi wille, thou schalt delyuere hir fre, nethir thou schalt mowe sille hir for money, nether oppresse bi power, for thou `madist hir lowe.
If a man hath twey wyues, oon loued, and `the tothir hateful, and he gendrith of hir fre children, and the sone of the hateful wijf is the firste gendrid,
and the man wole departe the catel bitwixe hise sones, he schal not mowe make the sone of the loued wijf the firste gendrid, and sette bifor the sone of the hateful wijf,
but he schal knowe the sone of the hateful wijf the firste gendrid, and he schal yyue to that sone alle thingis double of tho thingis that he hath; for this sone is the begynnyng of his fre children, and the firste gendrid thingis ben due to hym.
If a man gendrith a sone rebel, and ouerthewert, which herith not the comaundement of fadir and modir, and he is chastisid,
and dispisith to obei, thei schulen take hym, and schulen lede to the eldre men of that citee, and to the yate of doom;
and thei schulen seie to hem, This oure sone is ouerthewert and rebel; he dispisith to here oure monestyngis, `ethir heestis, he yyueth tent to glotonyes, and letcherie, and feestis.
The puple of the citee schal oppresse hym with stoonus, and he schal die, that ye do awei yuel fro the myddis of you, and that al Israel here, and drede.
Whanne a man doith a synne which is worthi to be punyschid bi deeth, and he is demed to deeth, and is hangid in a iebat,
his careyn schal not dwelle in the tre, but it schal be biried in the same dai; for he that hangith in the cros is cursid of God, and thou schalt not defoule thi lond which thi Lord God yaf thee in to possessioun.
Thou schalt not se `thi brotheris oxe, ethir scheep, errynge, and schalt passe, but thou schalt brynge ayen to thi brother.
And if thi brother is not nyy, nether thou knowist hym, thou schalt lede tho beestis in to thin hows, and tho schulen be at thee, as long as thi brother sekith tho, and til he resseyue hem.
In lijk maner thou schalt do of `the asse, and clooth, and of ech thing of thi brother, that was lost; if thou fyndist it, be thou not necgligent as of an alien thing.
If thou seest that the asse, ethir oxe of thi brothir felde in the weye, thou schalt not dispise, but thou schalt `reise with hym.
A womman schal not be clothid in a mannys clooth, nether a man schal vse a wommannys cloth; for he that doith thes thingis is abhomynable bifor God. If thou goist in the weie,
and fyndist a `nest of a brid in a tree, ethir in the erthe, and fyndist the modir sittynge on the briddis ethir eyrun, thou schalt not holde the modir with `the children, but thou schalt suffre `the modir go,
and schalt holde the sones takun, that it be wel to thee, and thou lyue in long tyme. Whanne thou bildist a newe hows,
thou schalt make a wal of the roof bi cumpas, lest blood be sched out in thin hows, and thou be gilti, if another man slidith, and falle in to a dich.
Thou schalt not sowe thi vyner `of another seed, lest bothe the seed which thou hast sowe, and tho thingis that `comen forth of the vyner, ben halewid togidere.
Thou schalt not ere with an oxe and asse togidere.
Thou schalt not be clothid in a cloth, which is wouun togidir of wolle and `of flex.
Thou schalt make litle cordis bi foure corneris in the hemmys of thi mentil, `with which thou art hilid.
If a man weddith a wijf, and aftirward hatith hir,
and sekith occasiouns bi which he `schal forsake hir, and puttith ayens hir `the werste name, and seith, Y haue take this wijf, and Y entride to hir, and Y foond not hir virgyn; the fadir and modir of hir schulen take
hir, and thei schulen bere with hem the signes of her virgynyte to the eldre men of the citee, that ben in the yate;
and the fadir schal seie, Y yaf my douytir wijf to this man, and for he hatith hir, he puttith to hir `the werste name,
that he seye, Y foond not thi douytir virgyn; and lo! these ben the signes of virgynyte of my douytir; thei schulen sprede forth a cloth bifor the eldre men of the citee. And the eldere men of that citee schulen
take the man, and schulen bete hym,
and ferthermore thei schulen condempne hym in an hundrid siclis of siluer, whiche he schal yyue to the `fadir of the damysel, for he diffamide the werste name on a virgyn of Israel; and he schal haue hir wijf, and he schal not mowe forsake hir, in al `the tyme of his lijf.
That if it is soth, that he puttith ayens hir, and virgynyte is not foundun in the damysel, thei schulen caste hir `out of `the yatis of
the hous of hir fadir; and men of that citee schulen oppresse hir with stoonys, and sche schal die, for sche dide vnleueful thing in Israel, that sche dide fornycacioun in `the hows of hir fadir; and thou schalt do awey yuel fro the myddis of thee.
If a man slepith with `the wijf of another man, euer eithir schal die, that is, auowter and auowtresse; and thou schalt do awey yuel fro Israel.
If a man spousith a damysel virgyn, and a man fyndith hir in the citee, and doith letcherie with hir,
thou schalt lede euer eithir to the yate of that citee, and thei schulen be oppressid with stoonus; the damysel schal be stonyd, for sche criede not, whanne sche was in the citee; the man schal `be stonyd, for he `made low the wijf of his neiybore; and thou schalt do awei yuel fro the myddis of thee.
Forsothe if a man fyndith in the feeld a `damysel, which is spousid, and he takith, and doith letcherie with hir, he aloone schal die;
the damysel schal suffre no thing of yuel, nethir is gilti of deeth; for as a theef risith ayens his brothir, and sleeth `his lijf, so and the damysel suffride; sche was aloone in the feeld,
sche criede, and noon was present, that schulde delyuer hir.
If a man fyndith a damysel virgyn that hath no spowse, and takith, and doith letcherie with hir, and the thing cometh to the doom,
he that slepte with hir schal yyue to `the fadir of the damysel fifti siclis of siluer, and he schal haue hir wijf, for he `made hir low; he schal not mow forsake hir, in alle the daies of his lijf.
A man schal not take `the wijf of his fadir, nethir he schal schewe `the hilyng of hir.
A geldyng whanne hise stoonys ben brokun, ethir kit awey, and his yerde is kit awei, schal not entre in to the chirche of the Lord.
A child borun of hordom schal not entre in to the chirche of the Lord, `til to the tenthe generacioun.
Ammonytis and Moabitis, yhe aftir the tenthe generacioun, schulen not entre into the `chirche of the Lord with outen ende;
for thei nolden come to you with breed and watir in the weie, whanne ye yeden out of Egipt; and for thei hireden ayens thee Balaam, the sone of Beor, fro Mesopotanye of Sirye, that he schulde curse thee;
and thi Lord God nolde here Balaam, and God turnede `the cursyng of Balaam in to thi blessyng, for he louyde thee.
Thou schalt not make pees with hem, nethir thou schalt seke goodis to hem, in alle the daies of thi lijf in to with outen ende.
Thou schalt not `haue abhomynacioun of a man of Ydumye, for he is thi brothir, nethir of a man of Egipt, for thou were a comelyng in the lond of hym.
Thei that ben borun of hem, schulen entre in the thridde generacioun in to the `chirche of the Lord.
Whanne thou schalt go out `in to batel ayens thin enemyes, thou schalt kepe thee fro al yuel thing.
If a man is among you, which is defoulid in `sleep of nyyt, he schal go out of `the castels ;
and he schal not turne ayen bifore that he be waischun in watir at euentid, and aftir the goyng doun of the sunne he schal go ayen in to the castels.
Thou schalt haue a place without the castels, to which thou schalt go out to nedeful thingis of kynde;
and thou schalt bere a litil stake in the girdil; and whanne thou hast sete, thou schalt digge `bi cumpas, and `thou schalt hile with erthe thingis `defied out,
where thou art releuyd. For thi Lord God goeth in the myddis of castels, that he diliuere thee, and bitake thin enemyes to thee, that thi castels be hooli, and no thing of filthe appere in tho, lest he forsake thee.
Thou schalt not bitake a seruaunt to his lord, which seruaunt fleeth to thee;
he schal dwelle with thee in the place that plesith hym, and he schal reste in oon of thi citees; and make thou not hym sori.
Noon hoore schal be of the douytris of Israel, nether a letchour of the sones of Israel.
Thou schalt not offre the hire of `an hoore hows, nether the prijs of a dogge, in the hows of thi Lord God, what euer thing it is that thou hast avowid; for euer eithir is abhomynacioun bifor thi Lord God.
Thou schalt not leene to thi brothir to vsure money, neither fruytis,
nethir ony othir thing, but to an alien. Forsothe thou schalt leene to thi brothir without vsure that that he nedith, that thi Lord God blesse thee in al thi werk, in the lond to which thou schalt entre to welde.
Whanne thou makist auow to thi Lord God, thou schalt not tarie to yelde, for thi Lord God schal `requyre, ether axe, that; and if thou tariest, it schal be arretid to thee in to synne.
If thou `nylt bihete, thou schalt be with out synne.
Forsothe thou schalt kepe, and `do that that yede out onys of thi lippis, as thou bihiytist to thi Lord God, and hast spoke with thin owne wille and thi mouth.
If thou entrist in to the vynere of thi neiybore, ete thou grapis, as myche as plesith thee; but bere thou not out with thee.
If thou entrist in to `the corn of thi freend, thou schalt breke `eeris of corn, and frote togidere with `the hond; but thou schalt not repe with a sikil.
If a man takith a wijf, and hath hir, and sche fyndith not grace bifor hise iyen for sum vilite, he schal write a `libel, ethir litil book, of forsakyng, and he schal yyue in `the hond of hir, and he schal delyuere hir fro his hows.
And whanne sche goith out, and weddith anothir hosebonde,
and he also hatith hir, and yyueth to hir a `litil booke of forsakyng, and delyuereth hir fro his hows, ethir certis he is deed,
the formere hosebonde schal not mow resseyue hir in to wijf, for sche is defoulid, and maad abhomynable bifore the Lord; lest thou make thi lond to do synne, which lond thi Lord God yaf to thee to welde.
Whanne a man hath take late a wijf, he schal not go forth to batel, nethir ony thing of comyn nede schal be enioyned to hym, but he schal yyue tent with out blame to his hows, that he be glad in o yeer with his wijf.
Thou schalt not take in the stide of wed the lowere and the hiyere queerne stoon of thi brothir, for he puttide his lijf to thee.
If a man is takun, `that is, conuyct in doom, bisili aspiynge to stele his brothir of the sones of Israel, and whanne he hath seeld hym, takith priys, he schal be slayn; and thou schalt do awey yuel fro the myddis of thee.
Kepe thou diligentli, lest thou renne in to the sijknesse of lepre, but thou schalt do what euer thingis the preestis of the kyn of Leuy techen thee, bi that that Y comaundide to hem, and `fille thou diligentli.
Haue ye mynde what thingis youre Lord God dide to Marie, in the weie, whanne ye yede `out of Egipt.
Whanne thou schalt axe of thi neiyebore ony thing which he owith to thee, thou schalt not entre in to his hows, that thou take awei a wed;
but thou schalt stonde with out forth, and he schal brynge forth that that he hath.
Sotheli if he is pore, the wed schal not dwelle bi nyyt at thee,
but anoon thou schalt yelde to hym bifor the goyng doun of the sunne, that he slepe in his cloth, and blesse thee, and thou haue riytfulnesse bifor thi Lord God.
Thou schalt not denye the hire of thi brother nedi and pore, ethir of the comelyng that dwellith with thee in thi lond, and is with ynne thi yatis;
but in the same dai thou schalt yelde to hym the prijs of his trauel, bifor the goyng doun of the sunne, for he is pore, and susteyneth therof his lijf; lest he crye ayens thee to the Lord, and it be arettid to thee into synne.
The fadris schulen not be slayn for the sones, nether the sones for the fadris, but ech man schal die for hys owne synne.
Thou schalt not `peruerte, ethir waiwardli turne, the doom of the comelyng, and of fadirles ethir modirles; nethir thou schalt take awei in the stide of wed the cloth of a widewe.
Haue thou mynde, that thou seruedist in Egipt, and thi Lord God delyuerede thee fro thennus; therfor Y comaunde to thee that thou do this thing.
Whanne thou repist corn in the feeld, and foryetist, and leeuest a repe, thou schalt not turne ayen to take it, but thou schalt suffre that a comelyng, and fadirles, ethir modirles, and a widewe take awei, that thi Lord God blesse thee in al the werk of thin hondis.
If thou gaderist fruytis of olyues, what euer thing leeueth in trees, thou schalt not turne ayen to gadere, but thou schalt leeue to a comelyng, fadirles, ether modirles, and to a widewe.
If thou gaderist grapis of the vyner, thou schalt not gadere raisyns that leeuen, but tho schulen falle in to the vsis of the comelyng, of the fadirles, ethir modirles, and of the wydewe.
Haue thou mynde that also thou seruedist in Egipt, and therfor Y comaunde to thee, that thou do this thing.
If cause is bitwixe ony men, and thei axen iugis, thei schulen yyue the victorie of riytfulnesse to him, whom thei perseyuen to be iust, thei schulen condempne hym of wickidnesse, whom thei perseyuen to be wickid.
Sotheli if thei seen hym that synnede, worthi of betyngis, thei schulen caste him doun, and make to be betun bifor hem; also the maner of betyngis schal be for the mesure of synne,
so oneli that tho passe not the noumbre of fourti, lest thi brother be to-rent viliche bifore thin iyen, and go awei.
Thou schalt not bynde the `mouth of the oxe tredynge thi fruytis in the corn floor.
Whanne britheren dwellen to gidere, and oon of hem is deed with out fre children, the wijf of the deed brother schal not be weddid to anothir man, but his brothir schal take hir, and schal reise seed of his brother.
And he schal clepe the firste gendrid sone `of hir bi the name `of hym, `that is, of the deed brothir, that his name be not don awei fro Israel.
Forsothe if he nyle take the wijf of his brother, which is due to hym bi lawe, the womman schal go to the yate of the citee; and sche schal axe the grettere men in birthe, and sche schal seie, `The brother of myn hosebonde nyle reise seed of his brother in Israel, nethir wole take me in to mariage.
And anoon thei schulen make hym to be clepid, and thei schulen axe. If he answerith, Y nyle take hir to wijf;
the womman schal go to hym bifor the eldre men of Israel, and sche schal take awei the schoo, and sche schal spete in to his face, and schal seie, So it schal be doon to the man, that bildith not `the hows of his brother;
and `the name of hym schal be clepid in Israel, The hows of the man vnschood.

Thou schalt not haue in the bagge dyuerse weiytis,

Thou schalt haue a iust weiyte and trewe, and an euene buyschel `and trewe schal be to thee, that thou lyue in myche tyme on the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
For the Lord schal haue hym abhomynable that doith these thingis, and he wlatith, `ethir cursith, al vnriytfulnesse.

And Egipcians turmentiden vs, and pursueden, and puttiden greuouseste birthuns.
And we crieden to the Lord God of oure fadris, which herde vs, and bihelde oure mekenesse, and trauel, and angwischis;
and he ledde vs out of Egipt in myyti hond, and arm holdun forth, in grete drede, in myraclis, and grete wondris,
and ledde vs in to this place; and yaf to vs a lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
And therfor Y offre now to thee the fyrste fruytis of the fruitis of the lond which the Lord yaf to me. And thou schalt leeue tho in the siyt of thi Lord God. And whanne thi Lord God is worchipid,

Thou schalt be blessid in citee, and blessid in feeld;
blessid schal be the fruyt of thi wombe, and the fruyt of thi lond, and the fruit of thi beestis; `blessid schulen be the flockis of thi grete beestis, and the fooldis of thi scheep;
blessid schulen be thi bernes, and `blessid schulen be `thi relifs;
thou schalt be blessid entrynge, and goynge out.
The Lord schal yyue thin enemyes fallynge in thi siyt, that schulen rise ayens thee; bi o weie thei schulen come ayens thee, and by seuene weies thei schulen fle fro thi face.
The Lord schal sende out blessyng on thi celeris, and on alle the werkis of thin hondis; and he schal blesse thee in the lond which thou hast take.
The Lord schal reise thee to hym silf in to an hooli puple, as he swoor to thee, if thou kepist the heestis of thi Lord God, and goist in his weies.
And alle the puples of londis schulen se, that the name of the Lord is inwardli clepid on thee, and thei schulen drede thee.
The Lord schal make thee to be plenteuouse in alle goodis, in fruyt of thi wombe, and in fruyt of thi beestis, in the fruyt of thi lond, which the Lord swoor to thi fadris, that he schulde yyue to thee.
The Lord schal opene his beste tresour, heuene, that he yyue reyn to thi lond in his tyme; and he schal blesse alle the werkis of thin hondis; and thou schalt leene to many folkis, and of no man thou schalt take borewyng.
The Lord God schal sette thee in to the heed, and not in to the tail, and euere thou schalt be aboue, and not bynethe; if netheles thou herist the comaundementis of thi Lord God, whiche Y comaunde to thee to day, and kepist,
and doist, and bowist not awey fro tho, nether to the riyt side nether to the lefte side, nether suest alien goddis, nethir worschipist hem.
That if thou nylt here the vois of thi Lord God, that thou kepe and do alle hise heestis, and cerymonyes, whiche Y comaunde to thee to day, alle these cursyngis schulen come on thee, and schulen take thee.
Thou schalt be cursid in citee, cursid in feeld.
Cursid `schal be thi berne, and cursid schulen be thi relifs.
Cursid schal be the fruit of thi wombe, and the fruyt of thi lond; `cursid schulen be the drooues of thin oxun, and the flockis of thi scheep.
Thou schalt be cursid goynge in, and `thou schalt be cursid goynge out.
The Lord schal sende on thee hungur, and thurst, and blamyng in to alle thi werkis whiche thou schalt do, til he al to-breke thee, and leese swiftli, for thi werste fyndyngis, in whiche thou hast forsake me.
The Lord ioyne pestilence to thee, til he waaste thee fro the lond, to which thou schalt entre to welde.
The Lord smyte thee with nedynesse, feuyr, and coold, brennynge, and heete, and with corrupt eir, and rust; and pursue thee til thou perische.
Heuene which is aboue thee be brasun; and the erthe which thou tredist be yrun.
The Lord yyue dust for reyn to thi lond, and aysche come doun fro heuene on thee, til thou be al to-brokun.
The Lord yyue thee fallynge bifor thin enemyes; bi o weie go thou ayens hem, and bi seuene weies fle thou, and be thou scaterid bi alle the rewmes of erthe;
and thi deed bodi be in to mete to alle volatils of heuene, and to beestis of erthe, and noon be that dryue hem awai.
The Lord smyte thee with the botche of Egipt, and `the Lord smyte the part of bodi wherbi `ordures ben voyded; also `the Lord smyte thee with scabbe, and yicchyng, so that thou mayst not be curid.
The Lord smyte thee with madnesse, and blyndnesse, and woodnesse of thouyt;
and grope thou in mydday, as a blynd man is wont to grope in derknessis; and dresse he not thi weies; in al tyme suffre thou fals chaleng, and be thou oppressid bi violence, nethir haue thou ony that schal delyuere thee.
Take thou a wijf, and anothir man sleepe with hir; bilde thou an hows, and dwelle thou not ther ynne; plaunte thou a vyner, and gadere thou not grapis therof.
Thin oxe be offrid bifor thee, and ete thou not therof; thin asse be rauyschid in thi siyt, and be not yoldun to thee; thi scheep be youun to thin enemyes, and noon be that helpe thee.
Thi sones and thi douytris be youun to another puple, `while thin iyen seen, and failen at the siyt of hem al day; and no strengthe be in thin hond.
A puple whom thou knowist not ete the fruytis of thi lond, and alle thi trauels; and euere be thou suffrynge fals calengis, and be thou oppressid in alle daies,
and wondrynge at the ferdfulnesse of tho thingis whiche thin iyen schulen se.
The Lord smyte thee with the worste botche in the knees, and in the hyndere partes of the leg; and thou mow not be heelid fro the sole of the foot `til to the top.
And the Lord schal lede thee, and thi kyng, whom thou schalt ordeyne on thee, in to a folc which thou knowist not, thou, and thi fadris; and thou schalt serue there to alien goddis, to a tre, and stoon.
And thou schalt be lost in to prouerbe, and fable to alle puplis, to whiche the Lord schal brynge thee yn.
Thou schalt caste myche seed in to the erthe, and thou schalt gadere litil; for locustis schulen deuoure alle thingis.
Thou schalt plaunte, and schalt digge a vyner, and thou schalt not drynke wyn, nether thou schalt gadere therof ony thing; for it schal be wastid with wormes.
Thou schalt haue olyue trees in alle thi termes, and thou schalt not be anoyntid with oile; for tho schulen falle doun, and schulen perische.
Thou schalt gendre sones and douytris, and thou schalt not vse hem; for thei schulen be led in to caitifte.
Rust schal waaste alle thi trees and fruytis of thi lond.
A comelyng, that dwellith with thee in the lond, schal stie on thee, and he schal be the hiyere; forsothe thou schalt go doun, and schalt be the lowere.
He schal leene to thee, and thou schalt not leene to hym; he schal be in to the heed, and thou schalt be in to the tail.
And alle these cursyngis schulen come on thee, and schulen pursue, and schulen take thee, til thou perische; for thou herdist not the vois of thi Lord God, nether kepist hise comaundementis and cerymonyes, whiche he comaundide to thee.
And signes, and grete wondris schulen be in thee, and in thi seed, til in to withouten ende;
for thou seruedist not thi Lord God in the ioye and gladnesse of herte, for the abundaunce of alle thingis.
Thou schalt serue thin enemye, whom God schal sende to thee in hungur, and thirst, and nakidnesse, and in pouert of alle thingis; and he schal putte an yrun yok on thi nol, til he al to-breke thee.
The Lord schal brynge on thee a folk fro fer place, and fro the laste endis of erthe, in to the licnesse of an egle fleynge with bire, of which folc thou maist not vnderstonde the langage;
a folk moost greedi axere, that schal not yyue reuerence to an elde man, nethir haue mercy on a litil child.
And schal deuoure the fruyt of thi beestis, and the fruytis of thi lond, til thou perischist, and schal not leeue to thee wheete, wyn, and oile, droues of oxun, and flockis of scheep,
til he leese thee, and al to-breke in alle thi citees, and til thi sadde and hiye wallis be distried, in whiche thou haddist trust in al thi lond. Thou schalt be bisegid withynne thi yatis in al thi lond, which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee.
And thou schalt ete the fruyt of thi wombe, and the fleischis of thi sones, and of thi douytris, whiche thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, in the angwisch and distriyng, bi which thin enemye schal oppresse thee.
A man delicat of lijf, and `ful letcherouse, schal haue enuye to his brother, and wijf that liggith in his bosum,
lest he yyue to hem of the fleischis of hise sones whiche he schal ete; for he hath noon other thing in biseging and pouert, bi which thin enemyes schulen waaste thee with ynne alle thi yatis.
A tendur womman and delicat, that myyte not go on the erthe, nether set a step of foot, for most softnesse and tendirnesse, schal haue enuye to hir hosebonde that liggith in hir bosum, on the fleischis of sone and douyter,
and on the filthe of skynnes, wherynne the child is wlappid in the wombe, that gon out of the myddis of hir `scharis, ethir hipe bonys, and on fre children that ben borun in the same our. Thei schulen ete `tho children priueli, for the scarsete of alle thingis in bisegyng and distriyng, bi which thin enemy schal oppresse thee with ynne thi yatis.
No but thou schalt kepe and do alle the wordis of this lawe, that ben writun in this volym, `ether book, and schalt drede his gloriouse name and ferdful, that is thi Lord God,
the Lord schal encreese thi woundis, and the woundis of thi seed; grete woundis and contynuel, sikenessis worste and euerlestinge.
And he schal turne in to thee alle the turmentyngis of Egipt, whiche thou dreddist, and tho schulen cleue to thee.
Ferthermore the Lord schal brynge on thee also alle the sorewis and woundis, that ben not writun in the volym of this lawe, til he al to-breke thee.
And ye schulen dwelle fewe in noumbre, that weren bifore as the sterris of heuene for multitude, for thou herdist not the vois of thi Lord God.
And as the Lord was glad bifore on you, and dide wel to you, and multipliede you; so he schal be glad, `and schal leese, and distrie you, that ye be takun awei fro the lond, to which thou schalt entre to welde.
The Lord schal leese thee in to alle puplis, fro the hiynesse of erthe `til to the termes therof; and thou schalt serue there to alien goddis, whiche thou knowist not, and thi fadris `knowen not, to trees and stoonys.
Also thou schalt not reste in tho folkis, nether rest schal be to the step of thi foot. For the Lord schal yyue to thee there a ferdful herte, and iyen failynge, and lijf waastyd with morenyng.
And thi lijf schal be as hangynge bifore thee; thou schalt drede in nyyt and dai, and thou schal not bileue to thi lijf.
In the morewtid thou schalt seie, Who schal yyue the euentid to me? and in the euentid `thou schalt seie, Who schal yyue the morewtid to me? for the drede of thin herte, bi which thou schalt be maad aferd, and for tho thingis whiche thou schalt see with thin iyen.
The Lord schal lede thee ayen bi schipis in to Egipt, by the weie of which he seide to thee, that thou schuldist no more se it. There thou schalt be seeld to thin enemyes, in to seruauntis and `hand maidis; and noon schal be that schal delyuere thee.
These ben the wordis of boond of pees, which the Lord comaundide to Moyses, that he schulde smyte with the sones of Israel in the lond of Moab, outakun that bond of pees, which he couenauntide with hem in Oreb.
And Moises clepid al Israel, and seide to hem, Ye sien alle thingis whiche the Lord dide bifor you in the lond of Egipt, to Farao and alle hise seruauntis, and to al his lond;
the greet temptaciouns whiche thin iyen sien, `tho signes, and grete wondris.
And the Lord yaf not to you an herte vndurstondynge, and iyen seynge, and eeris that moun here, til in to present dai.
He ledde you bi fourti yeer thoruy deseert; youre clothis weren not brokun, nether the schoon of youre feet weren waastid bi eldnesse;
ye eetun not breed, ye drunken not wyn and sidur, that ye schulden wite that he is youre Lord God.
And ye camen to this place; and Seon, the kyng of Esebon yede out, and Og, the kyng of Basan, and camen to us to batel. And we han smyte hem,
and we token awey the lond `of hem, and we yauen `the lond to possessioun, to Ruben, and to Gad, and to the half lynage of Manasses.
Therfor kepe ye the wordis of this couenaunt, and fille ye tho, that ye vndirstonde all thingis whiche ye schulen do.
Alle ye stonden to day bifor youre Lord God, youre princes, and lynagis, and the grettere men in birthe, and techeris, al the puple of Israel,
fre children, and youre wyues, and comelyngis that dwellen with thee in castels, outakun the heweris of stonus, and outakun hem that beren watris;
that thou go in the boond of pees of thi Lord God, and in the ooth which thi Lord God smytith with thee,
that he reise thee in to a puple to hym silf, and that he be thi Lord God, as he spak to thee, and as he swoor to thi fadris, to Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob.
And not to you aloone Y smyte this loond of pees, and conferme these othis,
but to alle men, present and absent.
For ye witen hou we dwelliden in the lond of Egipt, and how we passiden bi the myddis of naciouns; whiche ye passiden,
and siyen abhomynaciouns and filthis, that is, idols `of hem, tre and stoon, siluer and gold, whiche thei worschipiden.
Lest perauenture among you be man ether womman, meyne ether lynage, whos herte is turned away to dai fro youre Lord God, that he go, and serue the goddis of tho folkis; and a roote buriounnynge galle and bitternesse be among you;
and whanne he hath herd the wordis of this ooth, he blesse hym silf in his herte, and seie, Pees schal be to me, and Y schal go in the schrewidnesse of myn herte; and lest the drunkun take the thirsti,
and the Lord forgyue not to hym, but thanne ful greetli his strong veniaunce be feers, and the feruour ayens that man, and alle the cursis that ben writun in this book `sitte on hym; and `the Lord do away his name vndur heuene,
and waaste hym in to perdicioun fro alle the lynagis of Israel, bi the cursis that ben conteyned in the book of this lawe and of boond of pees.
And the generacioun suynge schal seie, and the sones that schulen be borun aftirward, and pilgrimys that schulen come fro fer, seynge the veniauncis of that lond, and the sikenessis bi whiche the Lord turmentide that lond,
brennynge `that lond with brymston and heete of the sunne, so that it be no more sowun, nether bringe forth ony grene thing, in to ensaumple of destriyng of Sodom and of Gommorre, of Adama and of Seboym, whiche the Lord destriede in his ire and stronge veniaunce.
And alle folkis schulen seie, Whi dide the Lord so to this lond? What is the greet ire of his stronge veniaunce?
and thei schulen answere, For thei forsoken the couenaunt of the Lord, whiche he couenauntide with her fadris, whanne he ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt,
and thei serueden alien goddis, and worschipiden hem, whiche thei knewen not, and to whiche thei weren not youun;
therfor the strong veniaunce of the Lord was wrooth ayens this lond, that he brouyte yn on it alle the cursis that ben writun in this book;
and he castide hem out of her lond, in ire and strong veniaunce, and in gretteste indignacioun; and he castide forth in to an alien lond, as it is preued to dai.
Thingis ben hid of oure Lord God, `that is, in his biforknowing, whiche thingis ben schewid to us, and to oure sones with outen ende, that we do alle the wordis of this lawe.
Therfor whanne alle these wordis comen on thee, blessyng ether cursing, which Y settide forth in thi siyt, and thou art led bi repentaunce of thin herte among alle folkis, in to whiche thi Lord God hath scaterid thee,
and turnest ayen to hym, and obeiest to hise comaundementis, as Y comaundide to thee to dai, with thi sones, in al thin herte and in al thi soule,
thi Lord God schal lede thee ayen fro thi caitifte, and schal haue mercy on thee, and eft he schal gadre thee from alle puplis, in to whiche he scateride the bifore.
If thou art scaterid to the endis of heuene, fro thennus thi Lord God schal withdrawe thee;
and he schal take and schal bringe thee in to the lond which thi fadris weldiden; and thou schalt holde it, and he schal blesse thee, and schal make thee to be of more noumbre than thi fadris weren.
Thi Lord God schal circumcide thin herte, and the herte of thi seed, that thou loue thi Lord God in al thin herte and in al thi soule, and maist liue.
Forsothe the Lord schal turne alle these cursyngis on thin enemyes, and on hem that haten and pursuen thee.
Sotheli thou schalt turne ayen, and schalt here the vois of thi Lord God, and schalt do alle the heestis whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai;
and thi Lord God schal make thee to be plenteuouse, in alle the workis of thin hondis, in the children of thi wombe, and in the fruyt of thi beestis, in abundaunce of thi lond, and in largenesse of alle thingis. For the Lord schal turne ayen, that he haue ioye on thee in alle goodis, as he ioyede in thi fadris;
if netheles thou herist the voys of thi Lord God, and kepist hise heestis and cerymonys, that ben writun in this lawe, and thou turne ayen to thi Lord God in al thin herte, and in al thi soule.
This comaundement whiche Y comaunde to thee to day,
is not aboue thee, nethir is set fer, nethir is set in heuene, that thou maist seie, Who of vs may stie to heuene, that he brynge it to vs, and we here, and fille in werk?
nether it is set biyende the see, `that thou pleyne, and seye, Who of vs may passe ouer the see, and brynge it til to vs, that we moun here and do that that is comaundid?
But the word is ful nyy thee, in thi mouth and in thin herte, that thou do it.
Biholde thou, that to day Y haue set forth in thi siyt lijf and good, and ayenward deeth and yuel;
that thou loue thi Lord God, and go in hise weies, and kepe hise heestis, and cerymonyes, and domes; and that thou lyue, and he multiplie thee, and blesse thee in the lond to which thou schalt entre to welde.
But if thin herte is turned awey, and thou nylt here, and thou art disseyued bi errour, and worschipist alien goddis,
and seruest hem, Y biforseie to thee to dai, that thou schalt perische, and schalt dwelle litil tyme in the lond to which thou schalt entre to welde, whanne thou schalt passe Jordan.
Y clepe to day heuene and erthe witnesses, that is, aungels and men, that Y haue set forth to you lijf and deeth, good and yuel, blessyng and cursyng; therfor chese thou lijf, that bothe thou lyue and thi seed,
and that thou loue thi Lord God, and obeie to his vois, and cleue to hym, for he is thi lijf, and the lengthe of thi daies; that thou dwelle in the lond, for which the Lord swoor to thi fadris, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he schulde yyue it to hem.
And so Moises yede, and spak alle these wordis to al Israel,
and seide to hem, Y am to dai of an hundrid and twenti yeer, Y may no ferthere go out and go yn, moost sithen also the Lord seide to me, Thou schalt not passe this Jordan.
Therfor thi Lord God schal passe bifore thee; he schal do awei these folkis in thi siyt, and thou schalt welde hem; and this Josue schal go bifor thee, as the Lord spak.
And the Lord schal do to hem as he dide to Seon, and Og kyng of Ammorreis, and to `the lond of hem; and he schal do hem awey.
Therfor whanne the Lord hath bitake to you also hem, ye schulen do in lijk maner to hem, as Y comaundide to you.
Do ye manli, and be ye coumfortid; nyle ye drede in herte, nethir drede ye at the siyt of hem, for thi Lord God hym silf is thi ledere, and he schal not leeue, nether schal forsake thee.
And Moyses clepid Josue, and seide to hym bifor al the multitude of the sones of Israel, Be thou coumfortid, and be thou strong; for thou schalt lede this puple in to the lond which the Lord swoor that he schal yyue to `the fadris of hem; and thou schalt departe it bi lot.
And the Lord hym silf whiche is youre ledere, schal be with thee, he schal not leeue, nether schal forsake thee; nyle thou drede, nether drede thou in herte.
Therfor Moyses wroot this lawe, and bitook it to the preestis, sones of Leuy, that baren the arke of the bond of pees of the Lord, and to alle the eldere men of Israel.
And Moyses comaundide to hem, and seide, Aftir seuen yeer, in the yeer of remyssioun, in the solempnete of tabernaclis,
whanne alle men of Israel schulen come togidere, that thei appere in the siyt of her Lord God, in the place `which the Lord chees, thou schalt rede the wordis of this lawe bifor al Israel,
while thei heren, and while al the puple is gaderid to gidere, as wel to men, as to wymmen, to litle children, and comelyngis that ben with ynne thi yatis; that thei here, and lerne, and drede youre Lord God, and kepe and fille alle the wordis of this lawe;
also that the sones of hem, that now knowen not, moun here, and that thei drede her Lord God in alle daies in whiche thei lyuen in the lond to whiche ye schulen go to gete, whanne Jordan is passid.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! the daies of thi deeth ben nyy; clepe thou Josue, and stonde ye in the tabernacle of witnessyng, that Y comaunde to hym. Therfor Moises and Josue yeden, and stooden in the tabernacle of witnessyng;
and the Lord apperide there in a pilere of cloude, that stood in the entryng of the tabernacle.
And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! thou schalt slepe with thi fadris, and this puple schal rise, and schal do fornycacioun aftir alien goddis in the lond, to which lond it schal entre, that it dwelle ther ynne; there it schal forsake me, and schal make void the boond of pees, which Y couenauntide with it.
And my strong veniaunce schal be wrooth ayens that puple in that dai, and Y schal forsake it, and Y schal hide my face fro it, and it schal be in to deuouryng; alle yuels and turmentyngis schulen fynde it, so that it seie in that dai, Verili for the Lord is not with me, these yuelis han founde me.
Forsothe Y schal hide, and schal hile `my face in that dai, for alle the yuels `whiche it dide, for it suede alien goddis.
Now therfor write ye to you this song, and `teche ye the sones of Israel, that thei holde it in mynde, and synge bi mouth; and that this song be to me for a witnessyng among the sones of Israel.
For Y schal lede hym in to the lond, for which Y swoor to hise fadris, flowynge with mylk and hony; and whanne thei han ete, and ben fillid, and ben maad fat, thei schulen turne to alien goddis, and thei schulen serue hem; and thei schulen bacbite me, and schulen make voide my couenaunt.
Aftir that many yuels and turmentyngis han founde hym, this song schal answere hym for witnessing, which song no foryetyng schal do awey fro the mouth of thi seed. For Y knowe the thouytis therof to day, what thingis it schal do, bifore that Y bringe it in to the lond which Y bihiyte to it.
Therfor Moises wroot the song, and tauyte the sones of Israel.
And the Lord comaundide to Josue, the sone of Nun, and seide, Be thou coumfortid, and be thou strong; for thou schalt lede the sones of Israel in to the lond which Y bihiyte, and Y schal be with thee.
Therfor aftir that Moises wroot the wordis of this lawe in a book, and fillide,
he comaundide to Leuytis that baren the ark of boond of pees of the Lord,
and seide, Take ye this book, and putte ye it in the side of the arke of boond of pees of youre Lord God, that it be there ayens thee in to witnessyng.
For Y knowe thi stryuyng, and thin hardest nol; yit while Y lyuede and entride with you, ye diden euere stryuyngli ayens the Lord; hou myche more whanne Y schal be deed.
Gadere ye to me all the grettere men in birthe, and techeris, bi youre lynagis, and Y schal speke to hem, herynge these wordis, and Y schal clepe ayens hem heuene and erthe.
For Y knowe, that aftir my deeth ye schulen do wickidli, and schulen bowe awei soone fro the weie which Y comaundide to you; and yuels schulen come to you in the laste tyme, whanne ye `han do yuel in the siyt of the Lord, that ye terre hym to ire bi the werkis of youre hondis.
Therfor while al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel herde, Moises spak the wordis of this song, and fillide `til to the ende.
Ye heuenes, here what thingis Y schal speke; the erthe here the wordis of my mouth.
My techyng wexe togidere as reyn; my speche flete out as dew, as lytil reyn on eerbe, and as dropis on gras.
For Y schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord; yyue ye glorie to oure God.
The werkis of God ben perfit, and alle hise weies ben domes; God is feithful, and without ony wickidnesse; God is iust and riytful.
Thei synneden ayens hym, and not hise sones in filthis, `that is, of idolatrie; schrewid and waiward generacioun.
Whether thou yeldist these thingis to the Lord, thou fonned puple and vnwijs? Whether he is not thi fadir, that weldide thee, and made, `and made thee of nouyt?
Haue thou minde of elde daies, thenke thou alle generaciouns; axe thi fadir, and he schal telle to thee, axe thi grettere men, and thei schulen seie to thee.
Whanne the hiyeste departide folkis, whanne he departide the sones of Adam, he ordeynede the termes of puplis bi the noumbre of the sones of Israel.
Forsothe the part of the Lord is his puple; Jacob is the litil part of his eritage.
The Lord foond hym in a deseert lond, `that is, priued of Goddis religioun, in the place of orrour `ethir hidousnesse, and of wast wildirnesse; the Lord ledde hym aboute, and tauyte hym, and kepte as the apple of his iye.
As an egle stirynge his briddis to fle, and fleynge on hem, he spredde forth his wyngis, and took hem, and bar in hise schuldris.
The Lord aloone was his ledere, and noon alien god was with hym.
The Lord ordeynede hym on an hiy lond, that he schulde ete the fruytis of feeldis, that he schulde souke hony of a stoon, and oile of the hardeste roche;
botere of the droue, and mylke of scheep, with the fatnesse of lambren and of rammes, of the sones of Basan; and that he schulde ete kydis with the merowe of wheete, and schulde drynke the cleereste blood of grape.
The louede puple was `maad fat, and kikide ayen ; maad fat withoutforth, maad fat with ynne, and alargid; he forsook God his makere, and yede awei fro `God his helthe.
Thei terriden hym to ire in alien goddis, and thei excitiden to wrathfulnesse in abhomynaciouns.
Thei offriden to feendis, and not to God, to goddis whiche thei knewen not, newe goddis, and freische camen, whiche `the fadris of hem worschipiden not.
Thou hast forsake God that gendride thee, and thou hast foryete `thi Lord creatour.
The Lord siy, and was stirid to wrathfulnesse; for hise sones and douytris terriden hym.
And the Lord seide, Y schal hyde my face fro hem, and Y schal biholde `the laste thingis of hem; for it is a waiward generacioun, and vnfeithful sones.
Thei terriden me in hym that was not God, and thei `terriden to ire in her vanytees; and Y schal terre hem in hym, that is not a puple, and Y schal terre hem `to yre in a fonned folk.
Fier, that is, peyne maad redi to hem, is kyndlid in my stronge veniaunce, and it schal brenne `til to the laste thingis of helle; and it schal deuoure the lond with his fruyt, and it schal brenne the foundementis of hillis.
Y schal gadere `yuels on hem, and Y schal fille myn arewis in hem.
Thei schulen be waastid with hungur, and briddis schulen deuoure hem with bitteriste bityng; Y schal sende in to hem the teeth of beestis, with the woodnesse of wormes drawynge on erthe, and of serpentis.
Swerd with outforth and drede with ynne schal waaste hem; a yong man and a virgyn togidre, a soukynge child with an elde man.
And Y seide, Where ben thei? Y schal make the mynde of hem to ceesse of men.
But Y delayede for the yre of enemyes, lest perauenture `the enemyes of hem shulden be proude, and seie, Oure hiy hond, and not the Lord, dide alle these thingis.
It is a folk with out counsel, and with out prudence;
Y wolde that thei saueriden, and `vnderstoden, and purueiden the laste thingis.
How pursuede oon of enemyes a thousynde of Jewis, and tweyne dryuen awey ten thousynde? Whether not therfore for her God selde hem, and the Lord closide hem togidere?
For oure God is not as the goddis of hem, and oure enemyes ben iugis.
The vyner of hem is of the vyner of Sodom, and of the subarbis of Gomorre; the grape of hem is the grape of galle, and the clustre is most bittir.
The galle of dragouns is the wyn of hem, and the venym of eddris, that may not be heelid.
Whether these thingis ben not hid at me, and ben seelid in myn tresouris?
Veniaunce is myn, and Y schal yelde to hem in tyme, that the foot of hem slide; the dai of perdicioun is nyy, and tymes hasten to be present.
The Lord schal deme his puple, and he schal do merci in hise seruauntis; the puple schal se that the hond of fiyteres is sijk, and also men closid failiden, and the residues ben waastid.
And thei schulen seie, Where ben `the goddis of hem, in whiche thei hadden trust?
Of whos sacrifices thei eeten fatnessis, and drunkun the wyn of fletynge sacrifices, rise thei and helpe you, and defende thei you in nede.
Se ye that Y am aloone, and noon other God is outakun me; Y schal sle, and Y schal make to lyue; Y schal smyte, and Y schal make hool; and noon is that may delyuere fro myn hond.
And Y schal reise myn hond to heuene, and Y schal seie, Y lyue with outen ende.
If Y schal whette my swerd as leit, and myn hond schal take doom, Y schal yelde veniaunce to myn enemyes, and Y schal quyte to hem that haten me.
Y schal fille myn arewis with blood, and my swerd schal deuoure fleischis of the blood of hem that ben slayn, and of the caitifte of the heed of enemyes maad nakid.
Folkis, preise ye the puplis of hym, for he schal venie the blood of hise seruauntis, and he schal yelde veniaunce in to the enemyes of hem; and he schal be merciful to the lond of his puple.
Therfor Moises cam, and spak alle the wordis of this song in the eeris of the puple; bothe he and Josue, the sone of Nun.
And `he fillide alle these wordis, and spak to alle Israel, and seide to hem,
Putte ye youre hertis in to alle the wordis whiche Y witnesse to you to day, that ye comaunde to youre sones, to kepe, and do tho, and to fulfille alle thingis that ben writun in the book of this lawe;
for not in veyn tho ben comaundid to you, but that alle men schulden lyue in tho; whiche wordis ye schulen do, and schulen contynue in long tyme in the lond, to which ye schulen entre to welde, whanne Jordan is passid.
And the Lord spak to Moises in the same day,
and seide, Stie thou in to this hil Abirym, that is, passyng, in to the hil of Nebo, which is in the lond of Moab, ayens Jerico; and se thou the lond of Canaan, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel to holde, and die thou in the hil.
In to which hil thou schalt stie, and schalt be ioyned to thi puplis, as Aaron, thi brother, was deed in the hil of Hor, and was put to his puplis.
For ye trespassiden ayens me, in the myddis of the sones of Israel, at the Watris of Ayenseiyng, in Cades of deseert of Syn; and ye halewiden not me among the sones of Israel.
Ayenward thou schalt se the lond, and schalt not entre in to it, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel.
This is the blessing, bi which Moises, the man of God, blesside the sones of Israel bifor his deeth;
and seide, The Lord cam fro Syna, and he roos to us fro Seir; he apperide fro the hil of Pharan, and thousandis of seyntis with hym; a lawe of fier in his riythond.
He louede puplis; alle seyntis ben in his hond, and thei that neiyen to hise feet schulen take of his doctryn.
Moisis comaundide lawe `to vs, eritage of the multitude of Jacob.
And the king schal be at the moost riytful, whanne princes of the puple schulen be gaderid togidere with the lynagis of Israel.
Ruben lyue, and die not, and be he litil in noumbre.
This is the blessyng of Juda; Lord, here thou the vois of Juda, and brynge in hym to his puple; hise hondis schulen fiyte for hym, and the helpere of hym schal be ayens hise aduersaries.
Also he seide to Leuy, Thi perfeccioun and thi techyng is of an hooly man, whom thou preuedist in temptacioun, and demedist at the Watris of Ayenseiynge;
which Leuy seide to his fadir and to his modir, Y knowe not you, and to hise britheren, Y knowe not hem; and knewen not her sones. These kepten thi speche, and these kepten thi couenaunt; A!
Jacob, thei kepten thi domes, and `thou, Israel, thei kepten thi lawe; thei schulen putte encense in thi strong veniaunce, and brent sacrifice on thin auter.
Lord, blesse thou the strengthe of hym, and resseyue thou the werkis of his hondis; smyte thou the backis of hise enemyes, and thei that haten hym, rise not.
And he seide to Benjamyn, The moost loued of the Lord schal dwelle tristili in hym, `that is, in the Lord; he schal dwelle al day as in a chaumbur, and he schal reste bitwixe the schuldris of hym.
Also he seide to Joseph, `His lond is of the Lordis blessyng; of the applis of heuene, and of the dewe, and of watir liggynge bynethe;
of the applis of fruytis of the sunne and moone; of the coppe of elde munteyns,
and of the applis of euerlastynge litle hillis;
and of the fruytis of the lond, and of the fulnesse therof. The blessyng of hym that apperide in the busch come on the heed of Joseph, and on the cop of Nazarey, `that is, hooli, among hise britheren.
As the first gendrid of a bole is the feirnesse of hym; the hornes of an vnicorn ben the hornes of hym; in tho he schal wyndewe folkis, `til to the termes of erthe. These ben the multitudis of Effraym, and these ben the thousyndis of Manasses.
And he seide to Zabulon, Zabulon, be thou glad in thi goyng out, and, Ysacar, in thi tabernaclis.
Thei schulen clepe puplis to the hil, there thei schulen offre sacrifices of riytfulnesse; whiche schulen souke the flowing of the see as mylk, and hid tresours of grauel.
And he seide to Gad, Gad is blessid in broodnesse; he restide as a lioun, and he took the arm and the nol.
And he siy his prinshed, that `the techere was kept in his part; which Gad was with the princes of the puple, and dide the riytfulnesses of the Lord, and his doom with Israel.
Also he seide to Dan, Dan, a whelp of a lioun, schal flowe largeli fro Basan.
And he seide to Neptalym, Neptalym schal vse abundaunce, and he schal be ful with blessyngis of the Lord; and he schal welde the see and the south.
Also he seide to Aser, Aser, be blessid in sones, and plese he hise britheren; dippe he his foot in oile.
Yrun and bras the scho of hym; as the dai of thi youthe so and thin eelde.
Noon other god is as the God of the moost riytful, that is, `as the God `of the puple of Israel, gouerned bi moost riytful lawe; the stiere of heuene is thin helpere; cloudis rennen aboute bi the glorie of hym.
His dwellynge place is aboue, and armes euerlastynge ben bynethe; he schal caste out fro thi face the enemy, and he schal seie, Be thou al to-brokun.
Israel schal dwelle trustili and aloone; the iye of Jacob in the lond of whete, and of wyn; and heuenes schulen be derk with dew.
Blessed art thou, Israel; thou puple that art saued in the Lord, who is lijk thee? The scheld of thin help and the swerd of thi glorie is thi God; thin enemyes schulen denye thee, and thou schalt trede her neckis.
Therfor Moyses stiede fro the feeldi places of Moab on the hil of Nebo, in to the cop of Fasga, ayens Gerico. And the Lord schewide to hym al the lond of Galaad `til to Dan,
and al Neptalym, and the lond of Effraym and of Manasses, and al the lond of Juda, `til to the laste see; and the south part,
and the breede of the feeld of Jerico, of the citee of Palmes `til to Segor.
And the Lord seide to hym, This is the lond for which Y swoor to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and Y seide, Y schal yyue it to thi seed; thou hast seyn it with thin iyen, and thou schalt not passe `to it.
And Moyses, the seruaunt of the Lord, was deed there, in the lond of Moab, `for the Lord comaundide.
And the Lord biriede hym in a valey of the lond of Moab, ayens Fegor, and no man knewe his sepulcre `til in to present day.
Moises was of an hundrid and twenti yeer whanne he diede; his iye dasewide not, nethir hise teeth weren stirid.
And the sones of Israel biwepten hym thretti daies in the feeldi places of Moab; and the daies of weilyng of men `bymorenynge Moises weren fillid.
Forsothe Josue, the sone of Nun, was fillid with `the spyrit of wisdom, for Moises settide hise hondis on hym; and the sones of Israel obeieden to Josue, and diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
And `a profete roos no more in Israel `as Moises, whom the Lord knewe face to face,
in alle myraclis, and grete wondris, whiche the Lord sente bi hym, that he schulde do in the lond of Egipt to Farao, and alle hise seruauntis, and to al the lond `of hym,
and al strong hond, and the `grete merueylis, whiche Moyses dide bifor al Israel.

Ezechie bigat Manasses. Manasses bigat Amon.

Asor bigat Sadoc. Sadoc bigat Achym.
Achym bigat Elyut. Elyut bigat Eleasar. Eleasar bigat Mathan.
Mathan bigat Jacob. Jacob bigat Joseph, the hosebonde of Marye, of whom Jhesus was borun, that is clepid Christ.
And so alle generaciouns fro Abraham to Dauid ben fourtene generacions, and fro Dauid to the transmygracioun of Babiloyne ben fourtene generaciouns, and fro the transmygracioun of Babiloyne to Crist ben fourtene generaciouns.
But the generacioun of Crist was thus. Whanne Marie, the modir of Jhesu, was spousid to Joseph, bifore thei camen togidere, she was foundun hauynge of the Hooli Goost in the wombe.
And Joseph, hir hosebonde, for he was riytful, and wolde not puplische hir, he wolde priueli haue left hir.
But while he thouyte thes thingis, lo! the aungel of the Lord apperide `in sleep to hym, and seide, Joseph, the sone of Dauid, nyle thou drede to take Marie, thi wijf; for that thing that is borun in hir is of the Hooli Goost.
And she shal bere a sone, and thou shalt clepe his name Jhesus; for he schal make his puple saaf fro her synnes.
For al this thing was don, that it schulde be fulfillid, that was seid of the Lord bi a prophete, seiynge, Lo!
a virgyn shal haue in wombe, and she schal bere a sone, and thei schulen clepe his name Emanuel, that is to seie, God with vs.
And Joseph roos fro sleepe, and dide as the aungel of the Lord comaundide hym, and took Marie, his wijf;
and he knew her not, til she hadde borun her firste bigete sone, and clepide his name Jhesus.
Therfor whanne Jhesus was borun in Bethleem of Juda, in the daies of king Eroude, lo! astromyenes camen fro the eest to Jerusalem,
and seiden, Where is he, that is borun king of Jewis? for we han seyn his sterre in the eest, and we comen to worschipe him.
But king Eroude herde, and was trublid, and al Jerusalem with hym.
And he gaderide to gidre alle the prynces of prestis, and scribis of the puple, and enqueride of hem, where Crist shulde be borun.
And thei seiden to hym, In Bethleem of Juda; for so it is writun bi a profete,
And thou, Bethleem, the lond of Juda, art not the leest among the prynces of Juda; for of thee a duyk schal go out, that schal gouerne my puple of Israel.
Thanne Eroude clepide pryueli the astromyens, and lernyde bisili of hem the tyme of the sterre that apperide to hem.
And he sente hem in to Bethleem, and seide, Go ye, and axe ye bisili of the child, and whanne yee han foundun, telle ye it to me, that Y also come, and worschipe hym.
And whanne thei hadden herd the kyng, thei wenten forth. And lo! the sterre, that thei siyen in the eest, wente bifore hem, til it cam, and stood aboue, where the child was.
And thei siyen the sterre, and ioyeden with a ful greet ioye.
And thei entriden in to the hous, and founden the child with Marie, his modir; and thei felden doun, and worschipiden him. And whanne thei hadden openyd her tresouris, thei offryden to hym yiftis, gold, encense, and myrre.
And whanne thei hadden take an aunswere in sleep, that thei schulden not turne ayen to Eroude, thei turneden ayen bi anothir weie in to her cuntrey.
And whanne thei weren goon, lo! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep, and seide, Rise vp, and take the child and his modir, and fle in to Egipt, and be thou there, til that I seie to thee; for it is to come, that Eroude seke the child, to destrie hym.
And Joseph roos, and took the child and his modir bi nyyt, and wente in to Egipt,
and he was there to the deeth of Eroude; that it schulde be fulfillid, that was seid of the Lord bi the profete, seiynge, Fro Egipt Y haue clepid my sone.
Thanne Eroude seynge that he was disseyued of the astromyens, was ful wrooth; and he sente, and slowe alle the children, that weren in Bethleem, and in alle the coostis therof, fro two yeer age and with inne, aftir the tyme that he had enquerid of the astromyens.
Thanne `it was fulfillid, that was seid bi Jeremye, the profete,
seiynge, A vois was herd an hiy, wepynge and moche weilyng, Rachel biwepynge hir sones, and she wolde not be coumfortid, for thei ben noyt.
But whanne Eroude was deed, loo! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep in Egipt,
and seide, Ryse vp, and take the child and his modir, and go in to the lond of Israel; for thei that souyten the lijf of the chijld ben deed.
Joseph roos, and took the child and his modir, and cam in to the loond of Israel.
And he herde that Archilaus regnede in Judee for Eroude, his fadir, and dredde to go thidir. And he was warned in sleep, and wente in to the parties of Galilee;
and cam, and dwelte in a citee, that ys clepid Nazareth, that it shulde be fulfillid, that was seid bi profetis, For he shal be clepid a Nazarey.
In tho daies Joon Baptist cam, and prechide in the desert of Judee,
and seide, Do ye penaunce, for the kyngdom of heuenes shal neiye.
For this is he, of whom it is seid bi Ysaie, the prophete, seyinge, A vois of a crier in desert, Make ye redi the weies of the Lord; make ye riyt the pathis of hym.
And this Joon hadde clothing of camels heeris, and a girdil of skynne aboute hise leendis; and his mete was honysoukis, and hony of the wode.
Thanne Jerusalem wente out to hym, and al Judee, and al the cuntre aboute Jordan;
and thei weren waischun of hym in Jordan, `and knowlechiden her synnes.
But he siy manye of the Farysees and of Saduceis comynge to his baptym, and seide to hem, Generaciouns of eddris, who shewide to you to fle fro the wraththe that is to come?
Therfor do ye worthi fruyte of penaunce,
and nyle ye seie with ynne you, We han Abraham to fadir; for Y seie to you, that God is myyti to reise vp of these stoones the sones of Abraham.
And now the ax is put to the roote of the tree; therfore euery tree that makith not good fruyt, shal be kit doun, and shal be cast in to the fier.
Y waische you in water, in to penaunce; but he that shal come after me is strongere than Y, whos schoon Y am not worthi to bere; he shal baptise you in the Hooli Goost and fier.
Whos wynewing cloth is in his hoond, and he shal fulli clense his corn flore, and shal gadere his whete in to his berne; but the chaffe he shal brenne with fier that mai not be quenchid.
Thanne Jhesus cam fro Galilee in to Jordan to Joon, to be baptised of hym.
And Joon forbede him, and seide, Y owe to be baptisid of thee, and thou comest to me?
But Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Suffre nowe, for thus it fallith to vs to fulfille al riytfulnesse.
Thanne Joon suffride hym. And whanne Jhesus was baptisid, anoon he wente up fro the watir; and lo! heuenes weren openyd to hym, and he saie the Spirit of God comynge doun as a dowue, and comynge on hym; and loo!
a vois fro heuenes, seiynge, This is my louyd sone, in which Y haue plesid to me.
Thanne Jhesus was led of a spirit in to desert, to be temptid of the feend.
And whanne he hadde fastid fourti daies and fourti nyytis, aftirward he hungride.
And the tempter cam nyy, and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, seie that thes stoones be maad looues.
Which answeride, and seide to hym, It is writun, Not oonli in breed luyeth man, but in ech word that cometh of Goddis mouth.
Thanne the feend took hym in to the hooli citee, and settide hym on the pynacle of the temple,
and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, sende thee adoun; for it is writun, That to hise aungels he comaundide of thee, and thei schulen take thee in hondis, lest perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon.
Eftsoone Jhesus seide to hym, It is writun, Thou shalt not tempte thi Lord God.
Eftsoone the feend took hym in to a ful hiy hil, and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world, and the ioye of hem;
and seide to hym, Alle these `Y schal yyue to thee, if thou falle doun and worschipe me.
Thanne Jhesus seide to hym, Goo, Sathanas; for it is writun, Thou schalt worschipe thi Lord God, and to hym aloone thou shalt serue.
Thanne the feend lafte hym; and lo! aungels camen nyy, and serueden to hym.
But whanne Jhesus hadde herd that Joon was takun, he wente in to Galilee.
And he lefte the citee of Nazareth, and cam, and dwelte in the citee of Cafarnaum, biside the see, in the coostis of Zabulon and Neptalym,
that it shulde be fulfillid, that was seid by Ysaie, the profete, seiynge,
The lond of Sabulon and the lond of Neptalym, the weie of the see ouer Jordan, of Galilee of hethen men,
the puple that walkide in derknessis saye greet liyt, and while men satten in the cuntre of shadewe of deth, liyt aroos to hem.
Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to preche, and seie, Do ye penaunce, for the kyngdom of heuenes schal come niy.
And Jhesus walkide bisidis the see of Galilee, and saye twei britheren, Symount, that is clepid Petre, and Andrewe, his brothir, castynge nettis in to the see; for thei weren fischeris.
And he seide to hem, Come ye aftir me, and Y shal make you to be maad fisscheris of men.
And anoon thei leften the nettis, and sueden hym.
And he yede forth fro that place, and saie tweyne othere britheren, James of Zebede, and Joon, his brother, in a schip with Zebede, her fadir, amendynge her nettis, and he clepide hem.
And anoon thei leften the nettis and the fadir, and sueden hym.
And Jhesus yede aboute al Galilee, techynge in the synagogis of hem, and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom, and heelynge euery languor and eche sekenesse among the puple.
And his fame wente in to al Sirie; and thei brouyten to hym alle that weren at male ese, and that weren take with dyuerse languores and turmentis, and hem that hadden feendis, and lunatike men, and men in palesy, and he heelide hem.
And ther sueden hym myche puple of Galile, and of Decapoli, and of Jerusalem, and of Judee, and of biyende Jordan.
And Jhesus, seynge the puple, wente vp in to an hil; and whanne he was set, hise disciplis camen to hym.
And he openyde his mouth, and tauyte hem, and seide,
Blessed ben pore men in spirit, for the kyngdom of heuenes is herne.
Blessid ben mylde men, for thei schulen welde the erthe.
Blessid ben thei that mornen, for thei schulen be coumfortid.
Blessid ben thei that hungren and thristen riytwisnesse, for thei schulen be fulfillid.
Blessid ben merciful men, for thei schulen gete merci.
Blessid ben thei that ben of clene herte, for thei schulen se God.
Blessid ben pesible men, for thei schulen be clepid Goddis children.
Blessid ben thei that suffren persecusioun for riytfulnesse, for the kingdam of heuenes is herne.
`Ye schulen be blessid, whanne men schulen curse you, and schulen pursue you, and shulen seie al yuel ayens you liynge, for me.
Ioie ye, and be ye glad, for youre meede is plenteuouse in heuenes; for so thei han pursued `also profetis that weren bifor you.
Ye ben salt of the erthe; that if the salt vanysche awey, whereynne schal it be saltid? To no thing it is worth ouere, no but that it be cast out, and be defoulid of men.
Ye ben liyt of the world; a citee set on an hil may not be hid;
ne me teendith not a lanterne, and puttith it vndur a busschel, but on a candilstike, that it yyue liyt to alle that ben in the hous.
So schyne youre liyt befor men, that thei se youre goode werkis, and glorifie youre fadir that is in heuenes.
Nil ye deme, that Y cam to vndo the lawe, or the profetis; Y cam not to vndo the lawe, but to fulfille.
Forsothe Y seie to you, til heuene and erthe passe, o lettir or o titel shal not passe fro the lawe, til alle thingis be doon.
Therfor he that brekith oon of these leeste maundementis, and techith thus men, schal be clepid the leste in the rewme of heuenes; `but he that doith, and techith, schal be clepid greet in the kyngdom of heuenes.
And Y seie to you, that but your riytfulnesse be more plenteuouse than of scribis and of Farisees, ye schulen not entre into the kyngdom of heuenes.
Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt not slee; and he that sleeth, schal be gilti to doom.
But Y seie to you, that ech man that is wrooth to his brothir, schal be gilti to doom; and he that seith to his brother, Fy! schal be gilti to the counseil; but he that seith, Fool, schal be gilti to the fier of helle.
Therfor if thou offrist thi yifte `at the auter, and ther thou bithenkist, that thi brothir hath sum what ayens thee,
leeue there thi yifte bifor the auter, and go first to be recounselid to thi brothir, and thanne thou schalt come, and schalt offre thi yifte.
Be thou consentynge to thin aduersarie soone, while thou art in the weie with hym, lest perauenture thin aduersarie take thee to the domesman, and the domesman take thee to the mynystre, and thou be sent in to prisoun.
Treuli Y seie to thee, thou shalt not go out fro thennus, til thou yelde the last ferthing.
Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt `do no letcherie.
But Y seie to you, that euery man that seeth a womman for to coueite hir, hath now do letcherie bi hir in his herte.
That if thi riyt iye sclaundre thee, pulle hym out, and caste fro thee; for it spedith to thee, that oon of thi membris perische, than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
And if thi riyt hond sclaundre thee, kitte hym aweye, and caste fro thee; for it spedith to thee that oon of thi membris perische, than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
And it hath be seyd, Who euere leeueth his wijf, yyue he to hir a libel of forsakyng.
But Y seie to you, that euery man that leeueth his wijf, outtakun cause of fornycacioun, makith hir to do letcherie, and he that weddith the forsakun wijf, doith auowtrye.
Eftsoone ye han herd, that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt not forswere, but thou schalt yelde thin othis to the Lord.
But Y seie to you, that ye swere not `for ony thing; nethir bi heuene, for it is the trone of God;
nether bi the erthe, for it is the stole of his feet; nether bi Jerusalem, for it is the citee of a greet kyng; nether thou shalt not swere bi thin heed,
for thou maist not make oon heere white, ne blacke;
but be youre word, Yhe, yhe; Nay, nay; and that that is more than these, is of yuel.
Ye han herd that it hath be seid, Iye for iye, and tothe for tothe.
But Y seie to you, that ye ayenstonde not an yuel man; but if ony smyte thee in the riyt cheke, schewe to him also the tothir;
and to hym that wole stryue with thee in doom, and take awey thi coote, leeue thou `to him also thi mantil;
and who euer constreyneth thee a thousynde pacis, go thou with hym othir tweyne.
Yyue thou to hym that axith of thee, and turne not awey fro hym that wole borewe of thee.
Ye han herd that it was seid, Thou shalt loue thi neiybore, and hate thin enemye.
But Y seie to you, loue ye youre enemyes, do ye wel to hem that hatiden you, and preye ye for hem that pursuen, and sclaundren you;
that ye be the sones of your fadir that is in heuenes, that makith his sunne to rise vpon goode `and yuele men, and reyneth on iust men and vniuste.
For if ye louen hem that louen you, what mede schulen ye han? whether pupplicans doon not this?
And if ye greten youre britheren oonli, what schulen ye do more? ne doon not hethene men this?
Therfore be ye parfit, as youre heuenli fadir is parfit.
Takith hede, that ye do not youre riytwisnesse bifor men, to be seyn of hem, ellis ye schulen haue no meede at youre fadir that is in heuenes.
Therfore whanne thou doist almes, nyle thou trumpe tofore thee, as ypocritis doon in synagogis and stretis, that thei be worschipid of men; sotheli Y seie to you, they han resseyued her meede.
But whanne thou doist almes, knowe not thi left hond what thi riyt hond doith, that thin almes be in hidils,
and thi fadir that seeth in hiddils, schal quyte thee.
And whanne ye preyen, ye schulen not be as ipocritis, that louen to preye stondynge in synagogis and corneris of stretis, to be seyn of men; treuli Y seie to you, thei han resseyued her meede.
But whanne thou schalt preye, entre in to thi couche, and whanne the dore is schet, preye thi fadir in hidils, and thi fadir that seeth in hidils, schal yelde to thee.
But in preiyng nyle yee speke myche, as hethene men doon, for thei gessen that thei ben herd in her myche speche.
Therfor nyle ye be maad lich to hem, for your fadir woot what is nede to you, bifore that ye axen hym.
And thus ye schulen preye, Oure fadir that art in heuenes, halewid be thi name;
thi kyngdoom come to; be thi wille don `in erthe as in heuene;
yyue to vs this dai oure `breed ouer othir substaunce;
and foryyue to vs oure dettis, as we foryyuen to oure dettouris; and lede vs not in to temptacioun,
but delyuere vs fro yuel.
Amen. For if ye foryyuen to men her synnes, youre heuenli fadir schal foryyue to you youre trespassis.
Sotheli if ye foryyuen not to men, nether youre fadir schal foryyue to you youre synnes.
But whanne ye fasten, nyle ye be maad as ypocritis sorewful, for thei defacen hem silf, to seme fastyng to men; treuli Y seie to you, they han resseyued her meede.
But whanne thou fastist, anoynte thin heed, and waische thi face,
that thou be not seen fastynge to men, but to thi fadir that is in hidlis, and thi fadir that seeth in priuey, shal yelde to thee.
Nile ye tresoure to you tresouris in erthe, where ruste and mouyte destrieth, and where theues deluen out and stelen;
but gadere to you tresouris in heuene, where nether ruste ne mouyte distrieth, and where theues deluen not out, ne stelen.
For where thi tresoure is, there also thin herte is.
The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye; if thin iye be symple, al thi bodi shal be liytful;
but if thin iye be weiward, al thi bodi shal be derk. If thanne the liyt that is in thee be derknessis, how grete schulen thilk derknessis be?
No man may serue tweyn lordis, for ethir he schal hate `the toon, and loue the tother; ethir he shal susteyne `the toon, and dispise the tothir. Ye moun not serue God and richessis.
Therfor I seie to you, that ye be not bisi to youre lijf, what ye schulen ete; nether to youre bodi, with what ye schulen be clothid. Whether lijf is not more than meete, and the bodie more than cloth?
Biholde ye the foulis of the eire, for thei sowen not, nethir repen, nethir gaderen in to bernes; and youre fadir of heuene fedith hem. Whether ye ben not more worthi than thei?
But who of you thenkynge mai putte to his stature o cubit?
And of clothing what ben ye bisye? Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld, how thei wexen. Thei trauelen not, nether spynnen;
and Y seie to you, Salomon in al his glorie was not keuered as oon of these.
And if God clothith thus the hei of the feeld, that to day is, and to morewe is cast in to an ouen, hou myche more you of litel feith?
Therfor nyle ye be bisi, seiynge, What schulen we ete? or, What schulen we drinke? or, With what thing schulen we be keuered?
For hethene men seken alle these thingis; and youre fadir woot, that ye han nede to alle these thingis.
Therfor seke ye first the kyngdom of God, and his riytfulnesse, and alle these thingis shulen be cast to you.
Therfor nyle ye be bisy in to the morew, for the morew shal be bisi to `hym silf; for it suffisith to the dai his owen malice.
Nile ye deme, `that ye be not demed; for in what doom ye demen,
ye schulen be demed, and in what mesure ye meten, it schal be meten ayen to you.
But what seest thou a litil mote in the iye of thi brother, and seest not a beem in thin owne iye?
Or hou seist thou to thi brothir, Brothir, suffre I schal do out a mote fro thin iye, and lo! a beem is in thin owne iye?
Ipocrite, `do thou out first the beem of thin iye, and thanne thou schalt se to do out the mote of the iye of thi brothir.
Nile ye yyue hooli thing to houndis, nethir caste ye youre margaritis bifore swyne, lest perauenture thei defoulen hem with her feet, and the houndis be turned, and al to-tere you.
Axe ye, and it schal be youun to you; seke ye, and ye schulen fynde; knocke ye, and it schal be openyd to you.
For ech that axith, takith; and he that sekith, fyndith; and it schal be openyd to hym, that knockith.
What man of you is, that if his sone axe hym breed, whethir he wole take hym a stoon?
Or if he axe fische, whether he wole take hym an edder?
Therfor if ye, whanne ye ben yuele men, kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre sones, hou myche more youre fadir that is in heuenes schal yyue good thingis to men that axen hym?
Therfor alle thingis, what euere thingis ye wolen that men do to you, do ye to hem, for this is the lawe and the prophetis.
Entre ye bi the streyt yate; for the yate that ledith to perdicioun is large, and the weie is broode, and there ben many that entren bi it.
Hou streit is the yate, and narwy the weye, that ledith to lijf, and ther ben fewe that fynden it.
Be ye war of fals prophetis, that comen to you in clothingis of scheep, but withynneforth thei ben as wolues of raueyn;
of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem. Whether men gaderen grapis of thornes, or figus of breris?
So euery good tre makith good fruytis; but an yuel tre makith yuel fruytis.
A good tre may not make yuel fruytis, nethir an yuel tre make good fruytis.
Euery tre that makith not good fruyt, schal be kyt doun, and schal be cast in to the fier.
Therfor of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem.
Not ech man that seith to me, Lord, Lord, schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes; but he that doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he schal entre in to the kyngdoom of heuenes.
Many schulen seie to me in that dai, Lord, Lord, whether we han not prophesied in thi name, and han caste out feendis in thi name, and han doon many vertues in thi name?
And thanne Y schal knouleche to hem, That Y knewe you neuere; departe awei fro me, ye that worchen wickidnesse.
Therfor ech man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem, schal be maad lijk to a wise man, that hath bildid his hous on a stoon.
And reyn felde doun, and flodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and russchiden `in to that hous; and it felde not doun, for it was foundun on a stoon.
And euery man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem not, is lijk to a fool, that hath bildid his hous on grauel.
And reyn cam doun, and floodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and thei hurliden ayen that hous; and it felde doun, and the fallyng doun therof was greet.
And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, the puple wondride on his techyng;
for he tauyte hem, as he that hadde power, and not as the scribis `of hem, and the Farisees.
But whanne Jhesus was come doun fro the hil, mych puple suede hym.
And loo! a leprouse man cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, if thou wolt, thou maist make me clene.
And Jhesus helde forth the hoond, and touchide hym, and seide, Y wole, be thou maad cleene. And anoon the lepre of him was clensid.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Se, seie thou to no man; but go, shewe thee to the prestis, and offre the yift that Moyses comaundide, in witnessyng to hem.
And whanne he hadde entrid in to Cafarnaum, `the centurien neiyede to him, and preiede him,
and seide, Lord, my childe lijth in the hous sijk on the palesie, and is yuel turmentid.
And Jhesus seide to him, Y schal come, and schal heele him.
And the centurien answeride, and seide to hym, Lord, Y am not worthi, that thou entre vndur my roof; but oonli seie thou bi word, and my childe shal be heelid.
For whi Y am a man ordeyned vndur power, and haue knyytis vndir me; and Y seie to this, Go, and he goith; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my seruaunt, Do this, and he doith it.
And Jhesus herde these thingis, and wondride, and seide to men `that sueden him, Treuli Y seie to you, Y foond not so greet feith in Israel.
And Y seie to you, that many schulen come fro the eest and the west, and schulen reste with Abraham and Ysaac and Jacob in the kyngdom of heuenes;
but the sones of the rewme schulen be cast out in to vtmer derknessis; there schal be wepyng, and grynting of teeth.
And Jhesus seide to the centurioun, Go, and as thou hast bileuyd, be it doon to thee. And the child was heelid fro that hour.
And whanne Jhesus was comun in to the hous of Symount Petre, he say his wyues modir liggynge, and shakun with feueris.
And he touchide hir hoond, and the feuer lefte hir; and she roos, and seruede hem.
And whanne it was euen, thei brouyten to hym manye that hadden deuelis, and he castide out spiritis bi word, and heelide alle that weren yuel at ese;
that it were fulfillid, that was seid by Ysaie, the profete, seiynge, He took oure infirmytees, and bar oure siknessis.
And Jhesus say myche puple aboute him, and bade hise disciplis go ouer the watir.
And a scribe neiyede, and seide to hym, Maistir, Y shal sue thee, whidir euer thou schalt go.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis, but mannus sone hath not where `he schal reste his heed.
Anothir of his disciplis seide to him, Lord, suffre me to go first, and birie my fader.
But Jhesus seide to hym, Sue thou me, and lete deed men birie her deede men.
And whanne he was goon vp in to a litil schip, his disciplis sueden hym.
And loo! a greet stiring was maad in the see, so that the schip was hilid with wawes; but he slepte.
And hise disciplis camen to hym, and reysiden hym, and seiden, Lord, saue vs; we perischen.
And Jhesus seide to hem, What ben ye of litil feith agaste? Thanne he roos, and comaundide to the wyndis and the see, and a greet pesibilnesse was maad.
And men wondriden, and seiden, What maner man is he this, for the wyndis and the see obeischen to him?
And whanne Jhesus was comun ouer the watir in to the cuntre of men of Gerasa, twey men metten hym, that hadden deuelis, and camen out of graues, ful woode, so that noo man myyte go bi that weie.
And lo! thei crieden, and seiden, What to vs and to thee, Jhesu, the sone of God? `art thou comun hidir bifore the tyme to turmente vs?
And not fer fro hem was a flocke of many swyne lesewynge.
And the deuelis preyeden hym, and seiden, If thou castist out vs fro hennes, sende vs in to the droue of swyne.
And he seide to hem, Go ye. And thei yeden out, and wenten in to the swyne; and loo! in a greet bire al the droue wente heedlyng in to the see, and thei weren deed in the watris.
And the hirdis fledden awey, and camen in to the citee, and telden alle these thingis, and of hem that hadden the feendis.
And lo! al the citee wente out ayens Jhesu; and whanne thei hadden seyn hym, thei preieden, that he wolde passe fro her coostis.
And Jhesus wente vp in to a boot, and passide ouer the watir, and cam in to his citee.
And lo! thei brouyten to hym a man sike in palesie, liggynge in a bed. And Jhesus saw the feith of hem, and seide to the man sike in palesye, Sone, haue thou trist; thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
And lo! summe of the scribis seiden withynne hem silf, This blasfemeth.
And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn her thouytis, he seide, Wherto thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertis?
What is liytere to seye, Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee, ethir `to seie, Rise thou, and walke?
But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power to foryyue synnes in erthe, thanne he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Rise vp; take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
And he roos, and wente in to his hous.
And the puple seynge dredde, and glorifiede God, that yaf suche power to men.
And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus, he say a man, Matheu bi name, sittynge in a tolbothe. And he seide to hym, Sue thou me.
And he roos, and folewide hym. And it was don, the while he sat `at the mete in the hous, lo! many pupplicans and synful men camen, and saten `at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis.
And Farisees sien, and seiden to hise disciplis, Whi etith youre maister with pupplicans and synful men?
And Jhesus herde, and seide, A leche is not nedeful to men that faren wel, but to men that ben yuel at ese.
But go ye, and lerne what it is, Y wole merci, and not sacrifice; for I cam, not to clepe riytful men, but synful men.
Thanne the disciplis of Joon camen to hym, and seiden, Whi we and Farisees fasten ofte, but thi disciplis fasten not?
And Jhesus seide to hem, Whether the sones of the spouse moun morne, as long as the spouse is with hem? But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste.
And no man putteth a clout of buystous clothe in to an elde clothing; for it doith awey the fulnesse of the cloth, and a wers breking is maad.
Nethir men putten newe wyne in to elde botelis, ellis the botels ben to-broke, and distried, and the wyn sched out. But men putten newe wyne in to newe botels, and bothe ben kept.
Whiles that Jhesus spak thes thingis to hem, lo! a prince cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, my douyter is now deed; but come thou, and putte thin hond on hir, and she schal lyue.
And Jhesus roos, and `hise disciplis, and sueden hym.
And lo! a womman, that hadde the blodi flux twelue yere, neiyede bihynde, and touchide the hem of his cloth.
For sche seide with ynne hir self, Yif Y touche oonli the cloth of hym, Y schal be saaf.
And Jhesus turnede, and say hir, and seide, Douytir, haue thou trist; thi feith hath maad thee saaf. And the womman was hool fro that our.
And whanne Jhesus cam in to the hous of the prince, and say mynstrallis, and the puple makynge noise,
he seide, Go ye a wei, for the damysel is not deed, but slepith. And thei scornyden hym.
And whanne the folc was put out, he wente in, and helde hir hond; and the damysel roos.
And this fame wente out in to al that loond.
And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus, twei blynde men criynge sueden hym, and seiden, Thou sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
And whanne he cam in to the hous, the blynde men camen to hym; and Jhesus seide to hem, What wolen ye, that I do to you? And thei seiden, Lord, that oure iyen be opened. And Jhesus seide, Bileuen ye, that Y mai do this thing to you? Thei seien to him, Yhe, Lord.
Thanne he touchide her iyen, and seide, Aftir youre feith be it doon to you.
And the iyen of hem were opened. And Jhesus thretenede hem, and seide, Se ye, that no man wite.
But thei yeden out, and diffameden hym thorou al that lond.
And whanne thei weren gon out, loo! thei brouyten to hym a doumbe man, hauynge a deuel.
And whanne the deuel was cast out, the doumb man spak. And the puple wondride, and seide, It hath not be say thus in Israel.
But the Farisees seiden, In the prince of deuelis he castith out deuelis.
And Jhesus wente `aboute alle the `citees and castels, techinge in the synagogis of hem, and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom, and helynge euery langour and euery sijknesse.
And he siy the puple, and hadde reuthe on hem; for thei weren trauelid, and liggynge as scheep not hauynge a scheepherde.
Thanne he seide to hise disciplis, Sotheli there is myche ripe corn, but fewe werk men.
Therfor preye ye the lord of the ripe corn, that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn.
And whanne his twelue disciplis weren clepid togidere, he yaf to hem powere of vnclene spiritis, to caste hem out of men, and to heele eueri langour, and sijknesse.
And these ben the names of the twelue apostlis; the firste, Symount, that is clepid Petre, and Andrew, his brothir; James of Zebede, and Joon, his brothir; Filip, and Bartholomeu;
Thomas, and Matheu, pupplican; and James Alfey, and Tadee;
Symount Chananee, and Judas Scarioth, that bitrayede Crist.
Jhesus sente these twelue, and comaundide hem, and seide, Go ye not `in to the weie of hethene men, and entre ye not in to the citees of Samaritans;
but rather go ye to the scheep of the hous of Israel, that han perischid.
And go ye, and preche ye, and seie, that the kyngdam of heuenes shal neiye;
heele ye sike men, reise ye deede men, clense ye mesels, caste ye out deuelis; freeli ye han takun, freli yyue ye.
Nyle ye welde gold, nether siluer, ne money in youre girdlis, not a scrippe in the weie,
nether twei cootis, nethir shoon, nether a yerde; for a werkman is worthi his mete.
In to what euere citee or castel ye schulen entre, axe ye who therynne is worthi, and there dwelle ye, til ye go out.
And whanne ye goon in to an hous, `grete ye it, and seyn, Pees to this hous.
And if thilk hous be worthi, youre pees schal come on it; but if that hous be not worthi, youre pees schal turne ayen to you.
And who euere resseyueth not you, nethir herith youre wordis, go ye fro that hous or citee, and sprenge of the dust of youre feet.
Treuly Y seie to you, it shal be more suffrable to the loond of men of Sodom and of Gommor in the dai of iugement, than to thilke citee.
Lo! Y sende you as scheep in the myddil of wolues; therfor be ye sliy as serpentis, and symple as dowues.
But be ye war of men, for thei schulen take you in counseilis, and thei schulen bete you in her synagogis;
and to meyris, or presidentis, and to kyngis, ye schulen be lad for me, in witnessyng to hem, and to the hethen men.
But whanne thei take you, nyle ye thenke, hou or what thing ye schulen speke, for it shal be youun `to you in that our, what ye schulen speke;
for it ben not ye that speken, but the spirit of youre fadir, that spekith in you.
`And the brother shal take the brother in to deeth, and the fader the sone, and sones schulen rise ayens fadir and modir, and schulen turmente hem bi deeth.
And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name; but he that shall dwelle stille in to the ende, shal be saaf.
And whanne thei pursuen you in this citee, fle ye in to anothir. Treuli Y seie to you, ye schulen not ende the citees of Israel, to for that mannus sone come.
The disciple is not aboue the maistir, ne the seruaunt aboue hys lord;
it is ynowy to the disciple, that he be as his maistir, and to the seruaunt as his lord. If thei han clepid the hosebonde man Belsabub, hou myche more his houshold meyne?
Therfor drede ye not hem; for no thing is hid, that schal not be shewid; and no thing is priuey, that schal not be wist.
That thing that Y seie to you in derknessis, seie ye in the liyt; and preche ye on housis, that thing that ye heeren in the ere.
And nyle ye drede hem that sleen the bodi; for thei moun not sle the soule; but rather drede ye hym, that mai lese bothe soule and bodi in to helle.
Whether twei sparewis ben not seeld for an halpeny? and oon of hem shal not falle on the erthe with outen youre fadir.
`And alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid.
Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben betere than many sparewis.
Therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men, Y schal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
But he that shal denye me bifor men, and I shal denye him bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
Nile ye deme, that Y cam to sende pees in to erthe; Y cam not to sende pees, but swerd.
For Y cam to departe a man ayens his fadir, and the douytir ayens hir modir, and the sones wijf ayens the housbondis modir;
and the enemyes of a man ben `thei, that ben homeli with him.
He that loueth fadir or modir more than me, is not worthi to me. And he that loueth sone or douyter ouer me, is not worthi to me.
And he that takith not his croos, and sueth me, is not worthi to me.
He that fyndith his lijf, shal lose it; and he that lesith his lijf for me, shal fynde it.
He that resseyueth you, resseyueth me; and he that resseyueth me, resseyueth hym that sente me.
He that resseyueth a prophete in the name of a prophete, shal take the mede of a prophete. And he that resseyueth a iust man in the name of a iust man, schal take the mede of a iust man.
And who euer yyueth drynke to oon of these leeste a cuppe of coolde watir oonli in the name of a disciple, treuli Y seie to you, he shal not leese his mede.
And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid, he comaundide to hise twelue disciplis, and passide fro thennus to teche and preche in the citees of hem.
But whanne Joon in boondis hadde herd the werkis of Crist, he sente tweyne of hise disciplis,
and seide to him, `Art thou he that schal come, or we abiden another?
And Jhesus answeride, and seide `to hem, Go ye, and telle ayen to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn.
Blynde men seen, crokid men goon, meselis ben maad clene, deefe men heren, deed men rysen ayen, pore men ben takun to `prechyng of the gospel.
And he is blessid, that shal not be sclaundrid in me.
And whanne thei weren goon awei, Jhesus bigan to seie of Joon to the puple, What thing wenten ye out in to desert to se? a reed wawed with the wynd?
Or what thing wenten ye out to see? a man clothid with softe clothis? Lo! thei that ben clothid with softe clothis ben in the housis of kyngis.
But what thing wenten ye out to se? a prophete? Yhe, Y seie to you, and more than a prophete.
For this is he, of whom it is writun, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, that shal make redi thi weye bifor thee.
Treuli Y seie to you, ther roos noon more than Joon Baptist among the children of wymmen; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes, is more than he.
And fro the daies of Joon Baptist til now the kyngdom of heuenes suffrith violence, and violent men rauyschen it.
For alle prophetis and the lawe `til to Joon prophecieden; and if ye wolen resseyue,
he is Elie that is to come.
He that hath eris of heryng, here he.
But to whom schal Y gesse this generacioun lijk? It is lijk to children sittynge in chepyng, that crien to her peeris,
and seien, We han songun to you, and ye han not daunsid; we han morned to you, and ye han not weilid.
For Joon cam nether etynge ne drynkynge, and thei seien, He hath a deuel.
The sone of man cam etynge and drynkynge, and thei seien, Lo! a man a glotoun, and a drinkere of wijne, and a freend of pupplicans and of synful men. And wisdom is iustified of her sones.
Thanne Jhesus bigan to seye repreef to citees, in whiche ful manye vertues of him weren doon, for thei diden not penaunce.
Wo to thee! Corosaym, woo to thee! Bethsaida; for if the vertues that ben doon in you hadden be doon in Tyre and Sidon, sumtyme thei hadden don penaunce in heyre and aische.
Netheles Y seie to you, it schal be lesse peyne to Tire and Sidon in the dai of doom, than to you.
And thou, Cafarnaum, whethir thou schalt be arerid vp in to heuene? Thou shalt go doun in to helle. For if the vertues that ben don in thee, hadden be don in Sodom, perauenture thei schulden haue dwellid `in to this dai.
Netheles Y seie to you, that to the lond of Sodom it schal be `lesse peyne in the dai of doom, than to thee.
In thilke tyme Jhesus answeride, and seide, Y knowleche to thee, fadir, lord of heuene and of erthe, for thou hast hid these thingis fro wijse men, and redi, and hast schewid hem to litle children;
so, fadir, for so it was plesynge tofore thee.
Alle thingis ben youune to me of my fadir; and no man knewe the sone, but the fadir, nethir ony man knewe the fadir, but the sone, and to whom the sone wolde schewe.
Alle ye that traueilen, and ben chargid, come to me, and Y schal fulfille you.
Take ye my yok on you, and lerne ye of me, for Y am mylde and meke in herte; and ye schulen fynde reste to youre soulis.
`For my yok is softe, and my charge liyt.
In that tyme Jhesus wente bi cornes in the sabot day; and hise disciplis hungriden, and bigunnen to plucke the eris of corn, and to ete.
And Fariseis, seynge, seiden to hym, Lo! thi disciplis don that thing that is not leueful to hem to do in sabatis.
And he seide to hem, Whether ye han not red, what Dauid dide, whanne he hungride, and thei that weren with hym?
hou he entride in to the hous of God, and eet looues of proposicioun, whiche looues it was not leueful to hym to ete, nether to hem that weren with hym, but to prestis aloone?
Or whether ye han not red in the lawe, that in sabotis prestis in the temple defoulen the sabotis, and thei ben with oute blame?
And Y seie to you, that here is a gretter than the temple.
And if ye wisten, what it is, Y wole merci, and not sacrifice, ye schulden neuer haue condempned innocentis.
For mannus Sone is lord, yhe, of the sabat.
And whanne he passide fro thennus, he cam in to the synagoge of hem.
And lo! a man that hadde a drye hoond. And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to hele in the sabot? that thei schulden acuse hym.
And he seide to hem, What man of you schal be, that hath o scheep, and if it falle in to a diche in the sabotis, whether he shal not holde, and lifte it vp?
How myche more is a man better than a scheep? Therfor it is leueful to do good in the sabatis.
Thanne he seide to the man, Stretche forth thin hoond. And he strauyte forth; and it was restorid to heelthe as the tothir.
And the Farisees wenten out, and maden a counsel ayens hym, hou thei schulden distrie hym.
And Jhesus knewe it, and wente awei fro thennus; and many sueden hym, and he helide hem alle.
And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden not make hym knowun;
that that thing were fulfillid, that was seid by Isaie, the prophete, seiynge, Lo!
my child, whom Y haue chosun, my derling, in whom it hath wel plesid to my soule; Y shal put my spirit on him, and he shal telle dom to hethen men.
He shal not stryue, ne crye, nethir ony man shal here his voice in stretis.
A brisid rehed he shal not breke, and he schal not quenche smokynge flax, til he caste out doom to victorie;
and hethene men schulen hope in his name.
Thanne a man blynde and doumbe, that hadde a feend, was brouyt to hym; and he helide hym, so that he spak, and say.
And al the puple wondride, and seide, Whether this be the sone of Dauid?
But the Farisees herden, and seiden, He this casteth not out feendis, but in Belsabub, prince of feendis.
And Jhesus, witynge her thouytis, seide to hem, Eche kingdom departid ayens it silf, schal be desolatid, and eche cite, or hous, departid ayens it self, schal not stonde.
And if Satanas castith out Satanas, he is departid ayens him silf; therfor hou schal his kingdom stonde?
And if Y in Belsabub caste out deuelis, in `whom youre sones casten out? Therfor thei schulen be youre domes men.
But if Y in the Spirit of God caste out feendis, thanne the kyngdom of God is comen in to you.
Ethir hou may ony man entre in to the hous of a stronge man, and take awey hise vesselis, but `he first bynde the stronge man, and thanne he schal spuyle his hous?
He that is not with me, is ayens me; and he that gaderith not togidere with me, scaterith abrood.
Therfor I seie to you, al synne and blasfemye shal be foryouun to men, but `the spirit of blasfemye shal not be foryouun.
And who euere seith a word ayens mannus sone, it shal be foryouun to him; but who that seieth a word ayens the Hooli Goost, it shal not be foryouun to hym, nether in this world, ne in `the tothir.
Ethir make ye the tree good, and his fruyt good; ether make ye the tree yuel and his fruyt yuel; for a tree is knowun of the fruyt.
Ye generacioun of eddris, hou moun ye speke goode thingis, whanne ye ben yuele? For the mouth spekith of plente of the herte.
A good man bryngith forth good thingis of good tresoure, and an yuel man bringith forth yuel thingis of yuel tresoure.
And Y seie to you, that of euery idel word, that men speken, thei schulen yelde resoun therof in the dai of doom;
for of thi wordis thou schalt be iustified, and of thi wordis thou shalt be dampned.
Thanne summe of the scribis and Farisees answeriden to hym, and seiden, Mayster, we wolen se a tokne of thee.
Which answeride, and seide to hem, An yuel kynrede and a spouse brekere sekith a tokene, and a tokene shal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the prophete.
For as Jonas was in the wombe of a whal thre daies and thre nyytis, so mannus sone shal be in the herte of the erthe thre daies and thre nyytis.
Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun, and schulen condempne it; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas, and lo! here a gretter than Jonas.
The queene of the south shal rise in doom with this generacioun, and schal condempne it; for she cam fro the eendis of the erthe to here the wisdom of Salomon, and lo! here a gretter than Salomon.
Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out fro a man, he goith bi drie places, `and sekith rest, and fyndith not.
Thanne he seith, Y shal turne ayen in to myn hous, fro whannys Y wente out. And he cometh, and fyndith it voide, and clensid with besyms, and maad faire.
Thanne he goith, and takith with him seuene othere spiritis worse than hym silf; and thei entren, and dwellen there. And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere. So it shal be to this worste generacioun.
Yit whil he spak to the puple, lo! his modir and his bretheren stoden withouteforth, sekynge to speke to hym.
And a man seide to hym, Lo! thi modir and thi britheren stonden withouteforth, sekynge thee.
He answeride to the man, that spak to hym, and seide, Who is my modir? and who ben my britheren?
And he helde forth his hoond in to hise disciplis, and seide, Lo! my modir and my bretheren;
for who euer doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he is my brothir, and sistir, and modir.
In that dai Jhesus yede out of the hous, and sat bisidis the see.
And myche puple was gaderid to hym, so that he wente up in to a boot, and sat; and al the puple stood on the brenke.
And he spac to hem many thingis in parablis, and seide, Lo! he that sowith, yede out to sowe his seed.
And while he sowith, summe seedis felden bisidis the weie, and briddis of the eir camen, and eeten hem.
But othere seedis felden in to stony places, where thei hadden not myche erthe; and anoon thei sprongen vp, for thei hadden not depnesse of erthe.
But whanne the sonne was risun, thei swaliden, and for thei hadden not roote, thei drieden vp.
And other seedis felden among thornes; and thornes woxen vp, and strangeleden hem.
But othere seedis felden in to good lond, and yauen fruyt; summe an hundrid foold, an othir sixti foold, an othir thritti foold.
He that hath eris of heryng, here he.
And the disciplis camen nyy, and seiden to him, Whi spekist thou in parablis to hem?
And he answeride, and seide to hem, `For to you it is youun to knowe the priuytees of the kyngdom of heuenes; but it is not youun to hem.
For it shal be youun to hym that hath, and he shal haue plente; but if a man hath not, also that thing that he hath shal be takun awei fro hym.
Therfor Y speke to hem in parablis, for thei seynge seen not, and thei herynge heren not, nether vndurstonden;
that the prophesie of Ysaie `seiynge be fulfillid `in hem, With heryng ye schulen here, and ye shulen not vndurstonde; and ye seynge schulen se, and ye shulen not se;
for the herte of this puple is greetli fattid, and thei herden heuyli with eeris, and thei han closed her iyen, lest sumtime thei seen with iyen, and with eeris heeren, and vndirstonden in herte, and thei be conuertid, and Y heele hem.
But youre iyen that seen ben blesside, and youre eeris that heren.
Forsothe Y seie to you, that manye profetis and iust men coueitiden to se tho thingis that ye seen, and thei sayn not, and to heere tho thingis that ye heren, and thei herden not.
Therfor here ye the parable of the sowere.
Ech that herith the word of the rewme, and vndirstondith not, the yuel spirit cometh, and rauyschith that that is sowun in his herte; this it is, that is sowun bisidis the weie.
But this that is sowun on the stony loond, this it is, that herith the word of God, and anoon with ioye takith it.
And he hath not roote in hym silf, but is temporal. For whanne tribulacioun and persecucioun is maad for the word, anoon he is sclaundrid.
But he that is sowun in thornes, is this that heerith the word, and the bisynesse of this world, and the fallace of ritchessis strangulith the word, and it is maad with outen fruyt.
But he that is sowun in to good loond, is this that herith the word, and vnderstondeth, and bryngith forth fruyt. And summe makith an hundrid fold, treuli anothir sixti fold, and another thritti fold.
Anothir parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem, and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a man, that sewe good seed in his feld.
And whanne men slepten, his enemy cam, and sewe aboue taris in the myddil of whete, and wente awei.
But whanne the erbe was growed, and made fruyt, thanne the taris apperiden.
And the seruauntis of the hosebonde man camen, and seiden to hym, Lord, whether hast thou not sowun good seed in thi feeld? where of thanne hath it taris?
And he seide to hem, An enemy hath do this thing. And the seruauntis seiden to him, `Wolt thou that we goon, and gaderen hem?
And he seide, Nay, lest perauenture ye in gaderynge taris drawen vp with hem the whete bi the roote.
Suffre ye hem bothe to wexe in to repyng tyme; and in the tyme of ripe corne Y shal seie to the reperis, First gadere ye to gidere the taris, and bynde hem to gidere in knytchis to be brent, but gadere ye whete in to my berne.
Another parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem, and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a corn of seneuey, which a man took, and sewe in his feeld.
Which is the leeste of alle seedis, but whanne it hath woxen, it is the moste of alle wortis, and is maad a tre; so that briddis of the eir comen, and dwellen in the bowis therof.
Another parable Jhesus spac to hem, The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to sour douy, which a womman took, and hidde in thre mesuris of mele, til it were alle sowrid.
Jhesus spac alle thes thingis in parablis to the puple, and he spac not to hem with out parablis, that it schulde be fulfillid,
that is seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Y shal opene my mouth in parablis; Y shal telle out hid thingis fro the makyng of the world.
Thanne he lefte the puple, and cam in to an hous; and hise disciplis camen to him, and seiden, Expowne to vs the parable of taris of the feeld.
Which answeride, and seide, He that sowith good seed is mannus sone;
the feeld is the world; but the good seed, these ben sones of the kyngdom, but taris, these ben yuele children;
the enemye that sowith hem is the feend; and the ripe corn is the endyng of the world, the reperis ben aungels.
Therfor as taris ben gaderid togidere, and ben brent in fier, so it shal be in the endyng of the world.
Mannus sone shal sende hise aungels, and thei schulen gadere fro his rewme alle sclaundris, and hem that doon wickidnesse;
and thei schulen sende hem in to the chymney of fier, there shal be weping and betyng to gidere of teeth.
Thanne iuste men schulen schyne as the sunne, in the rewme of her fadir. He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to tresour hid in a feld, which a man that fyndith, hidith; and for ioye of it he goith, and sillith alle thingis that he hath, and bieth thilk feeld.
Eftsoone the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a marchaunt, that sechith good margaritis;
but whanne he hath foundun o precious margarite, he wente, and selde alle thingis that he hadde, and bouyte it.
Eft the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a nette cast into the see, and that gaderith to gidere of al kynde of fisschis;
which whanne it was ful, thei drowen vp, and seten bi the brenke, and chesen the goode in to her vessels, but the yuel thei kesten out.
So it schal be in the endyng of the world. Aungels schulen go out, and schulen departe yuel men fro the myddil of iuste men.
And thei shulen sende hem in to the chymnei of fier; ther shal be weping and gryntyng of teeth.
Han ye vndirstonde alle these thingis? Thei seien to hym, Yhe.
He seith to hem, Therfor euery wise man of lawe in the kyngdom of heuenes, is lijk to an hosebonde man, that bryngith forth of his tresoure newe thingis and elde.
And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these parablis, he passide fro thennus.
And he cam in to his cuntrei, and tauyte hem in her synagogis, so that thei wondriden, and seiden, Fro whennus this wisdam and vertues camen to this?
Whether `is not this the sone of a carpentere? Whether his modir be not seid Marie? and hise britheren, James, and Joseph, and Symount, and Judas? and hise sistris,
whether thei alle ben not among us? Fro whennus thanne `alle thes thingis camen to this?
And so thei weren sclaundrid in hym. But Jhesus seide to hem, A profete is not with oute worschip, but in his owen cuntre, and in his owen hous.
And he dide not there manye vertues, for the vnbileue of hem.
In that tyme Eroude tetrarke, prynce of the fourthe part, herde the fame of Jhesu;
and seide to hise children, This is Joon Baptist, he is rysun fro deeth, and therfor vertues worchen in hym.
For Heroude hadde holde Joon, and bounde hym, and puttide hym `in to prisoun for Herodias, the wijf of his brothir.
For Joon seide to him, It is not leueful to thee to haue hir.
And he willynge to sle hym, dredde the puple; for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
But in the dai of Heroudis birthe, the douytir of Herodias daunside in the myddil, and pleside Heroude.
Wherfor with an ooth he bihiyte to yyue to hir, what euere thing she hadde axid of hym.
And she bifor warned of hir modir, seide, Yif thou to me here the heed of Joon Baptist in a disch.
And the kyng was sorewful, but for the ooth, and for hem that saten to gidere at the mete, he comaundide to be youun.
And he sente, and bihedide Joon in the prisoun.
And his heed was brouyt in a dische, and it was youun to the damysel, and she bar it to hir modir.
And hise disciplis camen, and token his bodi, and birieden it; and thei camen, and tolden to Jhesu.
And whanne Jhesus hadde herd this thing, he wente fro thennus in a boot, in to desert place bisides. And whanne the puple hadde herd, thei folewiden hym on her feet fro citees.
And Jhesus yede out, and sai a greet puple, and hadde reuthe on hem, and heelide the sike men of hem.
But whanne the euentid was com, hise disciplis camen to him, and seiden, The place is desert, and the tyme is now passid; lat the puple go in to townes, to bye hem mete.
Jhesus seide to hem, Thei han not nede to go; yyue ye hem sumwhat to ete.
Thei answeriden, We han not heere, but fyue looues and twei fischis.
And he seide to hem, Brynge ye hem hidur to me.
And whanne he hadde comaundid the puple to sitte to meete on the heye, he took fyue looues and twei fischis, and he bihelde in to heuene, and blesside, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis; and the disciplis yauen to the puple.
And alle eten, and weren fulfillid. And thei tooken the relifs of brokun gobetis, twelue cofynes ful.
And the noumbre of men that eten was fyue thousynde of men, outakun wymmen and lytle children.
And anoon Jhesus compellide the disciplis to go vp in to a boot, and go bifor hym ouer the see, while he lefte the puple.
And whanne the puple was left, he stiede aloone in to an hil for to preie. But whanne the euenyng was come, he was there aloone.
And the boot in the myddel of the see was schoggid with wawis, for the wynd was contrarie to hem.
But in the fourthe wakyng of the niyt, he cam to hem walkynge aboue the see.
And thei, seynge hym walking on the see, weren disturblid, and seiden, That it is a fantum; and for drede thei crieden.
And anoon Jhesus spac to hem, and seide, Haue ye trust, Y am; nyle ye drede.
And Petre answeride, and seide, Lord, if thou art, comaunde me to come to thee on the watris.
And he seide, Come thou. And Petre yede doun fro the boot, and walkide on the watris to come to Jhesu.
But he siy the wynd strong, and was aferde; and whanne he bigan to drenche, he criede, and seide, Lord, make me saaf.
And anoon Jhesus helde forth his hoond, and took Petre, and seide to hym, Thou of litil feith, whi hast thou doutid?
And whanne he hadde stied in to the boot, the wynd ceessid.
And thei, that weren in the boot, camen, and worschipiden hym, and seiden, Verili, thou art Goddis sone.
And whanne thei hadden passid ouer the see, thei camen in to the loond of Genesar.
And whanne men of that place hadden knowe hym, thei senten in to al that cuntre; and thei brouyten to hym alle that hadden siknesse.
And thei preieden hym, that thei schulden touche the hemme of his clothing; and who euere touchiden weren maad saaf.
Thanne the scribis and the Farisees camen to hym fro Jerusalem, and seiden,
Whi breken thi disciplis the tradiciouns of eldere men? for thei waisschen not her hondis, whanne thei eten breed.
He answeride, and seide to hem, Whi breken ye the maundement of God for youre tradicioun?
For God seide, Honoure thi fadir and thi modir, and he that cursith fadir or modir, die bi deeth.
But ye seien, Who euer seith to fadir or modir, What euere yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee;
and he hath not worschipid his fadir or his modir; and ye han maad the maundement of God voide for youre tradicioun.
Ypocritis, Isaie, the prophete, prophesiede wel of you,
and seide, This puple honourith me with lippis, but her herte is fer fro me;
and thei worschipen me `with outen cause, techynge the doctrines and maundementis of men.
And whanne the puple weren clepid to gidere to hym, he seide to hem, Here ye, and `vndurstonde ye.
That thing that entrith in to the mouth, defoulith not a man; but that thing that cometh out of the mouth, defoulith a man.
Thanne hise disciplis camen, and seiden to hym, Thou knowist, that, if this word be herd, the Farisees ben sclaundrid?
And he answeride, and seide, Eueri plauntyng, that my fadir of heuene hath not plauntid, shal be drawun vp by the roote.
Suffre ye hem; thei ben blynde, and leederis of blynde men. And if a blynd man lede a blynd man, bothe fallen doun in to the diche.
Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Expowne to vs this parable.
And he seide, Yit `ye ben also with oute vndurstondyng?
Vndurstonden ye not, that al thing that entrith in to the mouth, goith in to the wombe, and is sent out in to the goyng awei?
But tho thingis that comen forth fro the mouth, goon out of the herte, and tho thingis defoulen a man.
For of the herte goon out yuele thouytis, mansleyngis, auowtries, fornycaciouns, theftis, fals witnessyngis, blasfemyes.
Thes thingis it ben that defoulen a man; but to ete with hondis not waischun, defoulith not a man.
And Jhesus yede out fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tire and Sidon.
And lo! a womman of Canane yede out of tho coostis, and criede, and seide to him, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me; my douyter is yuel traueilid of a feend.
And he answeride not to hir a word. And hise disciplis camen, and preieden hym, and seiden, Leue thou hir, for she crieth aftir vs.
He answeride, and seide, Y am not sent, but to the scheep of the hous of Israel that perischiden.
And she cam, and worschipide hym, and seide, Lord, helpe me.
Which answeride, and seide, It is not good to take the breed of children, and caste to houndis.
And she seide, Yhis, Lord; for whelpis eten of the crummes, that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis.
Thanne Jhesus answeride, and seide to hir, A! womman, thi feith is greet; be it doon to thee, as thou wolt. And hir douytir was helid fro that hour.
And whanne Jhesus hadde passed fro thennus, he cam bisidis the see of Galilee. And he yede vp in to an hil, and sat there.
And myche puple cam to hym, and hadden with hem doumbe men and crokid, feble and blynde, and many other; and thei castiden doun hem at hise feet. And he helide hem,
so that the puple wondriden seynge doumbe men spekynge, and crokid goynge, blynde men seynge; and thei magnyfieden God of Israel.
And Jhesus, whanne hise disciplis weren clepid to gidere, seide to hem, Y haue reuthe of the puple, for thei han abiden now thre daies with me, and han no thing to ete; and Y wole not leeue hem fastynge, lest thei failen in the weie.
And the disciplis seien to him, Wherof thanne so many looues among vs in desert, to fulfille so greet a puple?
And Jhesus seide to hem, Hou many looues han ye? And thei seiden, Seuene, and a fewe smale fisshis.
And he comaundide to the puple, to sitte to mete on the erthe.
And he took seuene looues and fyue fischis, and dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis; and the disciplis yauen to the puple.
And alle eten, and weren fulfillid, and thei token that that was left of relifes, seuene lepis fulle.
And thei that eten weren foure thousynde of men, with outen litle children and wymmen.
And whanne he hadde left the puple, he wente vp in to a boot, and cam in to the coostis of Magedan.
And the Farisees and the Saducees camen to hym temptynge, and preieden hym to schewe hem a tokene fro heuene.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Whanne the euentid is comun, ye seien, It schal be clere, for heuene is rodi;
and the morewtid, To dai tempest, for heuene schyneth heueli.
Thanne ye kunne deme the face of heuene, but ye moun not wite the tokenes of tymes. An yuel generacioun and auoutresse sekith a tokene; and a tokene schal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the profete. And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente forth.
And whanne his disciplis camen ouer the see, thei foryaten to take looues.
And he seide to hem, Biholde ye, and be war of the soure dowy of Farisees and Saducees.
And thei thouyten among hem, and seiden, For we han not take looues.
But Jhesus witynge seide to hem, What thenken ye among you of litel feith, for ye han not looues?
Yit `vndurstonden not ye, nether han mynde of fyue looues in to fyue thousynde of men, and hou many cofyns ye token?
nether of seuene looues in to foure thousynde of men, and hou many lepis ye token?
Whi vndurstonden ye not, for Y seide not to you of breed, Be ye war of the sourdowy of Farisees and of Saducees?
Thanne thei vndurstooden, that he seide not to be war of sourdowy of looues, but of the techyng of Farisees and Saducees.
And Jhesus cam in to the parties of Cesarie of Filip, and axide hise disciplis, and seide, Whom seien men to be mannus sone?
And thei seiden, Summe Joon Baptist; othere Elie; and othere Jeremye, or oon of the prophetis.
Jhesus seide to hem, But whom seien ye me to be?
Symount Petre answeride, and seide, Thou art Crist, the sone of God lyuynge.
Jhesus answeride, and seide to him, Blessid art thou, Symount Bariona; for fleisch and blood schewide not to thee, but my fadir that is in heuenes.
And Y seie to thee, that thou art Petre, and on this stoon Y schal bilde my chirche, and the yatis of helle schulen not haue miyt ayens it.
And to thee Y shal yyue the keies of the kingdom of heuenes; and what euer thou shalt bynde on erthe, schal be boundun also in heuenes; and what euer thou schalt vnbynde on erthe, schal be vnbounden also in heuenes.
Thanne he comaundide to hise disciplis, that thei schulden seie to no man, that he was Crist.
Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to schewe to hise disciplis, that it bihofte hym go to Jerusalem, and suffre many thingis, of the eldere men, and of scribis, and princis of prestis; and be slayn, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
And Petre took hym, and bigan to blame him, and seide, Fer be it fro thee, Lord; this thing schal not be to thee.
And he turnede, and seide to Petre, Sathanas, go after me; thou art a sclaundre to me; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God, but tho thingis that ben of men.
Thanne Jhesus seide to his disciplis, If ony man wole come after me, denye he hym silf, and take his cros, and sue me; for he that wole make his lijf saaf,
shal leese it; and he that schal leese his lijf for me, schal fynde it.
For what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and suffre peiryng of his soule? or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule?
For mannes sone schal come in glorie of his fader, with his aungels, and thanne he schal yelde to ech man after his werkis.
Treuli Y seie to you, `ther ben summe of hem that stonden here, whiche schulen not taste deth, til thei seen mannus sone comynge in his kyngdom.
And after sixe daies Jhesus took Petre, and James, and Joon, his brother, and ledde hem aside in to an hiy hil,
and was turned in to an othir licnesse bifor hem. And his face schone as the sunne; and hise clothis weren maad white as snowe.
And lo! Moises and Elie apperiden to hem, and spaken with hym.
And Petre answeride, and seide to Jhesu, Lord, it is good vs to be here. If thou wolt, make we here thre tabernaclis; to thee oon, to Moises oon, and oon to Elye. Yit the while he spak, lo!
a briyt cloude ouerschadewide hem; and lo! a voice out of the cloude, that seide, This is my dereworth sone, in whom Y haue wel pleside to me; here ye hym.
And the disciplis herden, and felden doun on her faces, and dredden greetli.
And Jhesus cam, and touchide hem, and seide to hem, Rise vp, and nyle ye drede.
And thei liften vp her iyen, and saien no man, but Jhesu aloone.
And as thei camen doun of the hille, Jhesus comaundide to hem, and seide, Seie ye to no man the visioun, til mannus sone rise ayen fro deeth.
And his disciplis axiden hym, and seiden, What thanne seien the scribis, that it bihoueth that Elie come first?
He answeride, and seide to hem, Elie schal come, and he schal restore alle thingis.
And Y seie to you, that Elie is nowe comun, and thei knewen hym not, but thei diden in him what euer thingis thei wolden; and so mannus sone schal suffre of hem.
Thanne the disciplis vndurstoden, that he seide to hem of Joon Baptist.
And whanne he cam to the puple, a man cam to hym, and felde doun on hise knees bifor hym, and seide, Lord, haue merci on my sone; for he is lunatike, and suffrith yuele, for ofte tymes he fallith in to the fier, and ofte tymes in to water.
And Y brouyte hym to thi disciplis, and thei myyten not heele hym.
Jhesus answeride, and seide, A! thou generacion vnbileueful and weiward; hou long schal Y be with you? hou long schal Y suffre you? Brynge ye hym hider to me.
And Jhesus blamede hym, and the deuel wente out fro hym; and the child was heelid fro that our.
Thanne the disciplis camen to Jhesu priueli, and seiden to hym, Whi myyten not we caste hym out?
Jhesus seith to hem, For youre vnbileue. Treuli Y seie to you, if ye han feith, as a corn of seneueye, ye schulen seie to this hil, Passe thou hennus, and it schal passe; and no thing schal be vnpossible to you;
but this kynde is not caste out, but bi preiyng and fastyng.
And whilis thei weren abidynge togidere in Galilee, Jhesus seide to hem, Mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of men;
and thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
And thei weren ful sori.
And whanne thei camen to Cafarnaum, thei that token tribute, camen to Petre, and seiden to hym, Youre maister payeth not tribute?
And he seide, Yhis. And whanne he was comen in to the hous, Jhesus cam bifor hym, and seide, Symount, what semeth to thee? Kyngis of erthe, of whom taken thei tribute? of her sones, ether of aliens?
And he seide, Of aliens. Jhesus seide to hym, Thanne sones ben fre.
But that we sclaundre hem not, go to the see, and caste an hook, and take thilke fisch that first cometh vp; and, whanne his mouth is opened, thou schalt fynde a stater, and yyue for thee and for me.
In that our the disciplis camen to Jhesu, and seiden, Who, gessist thou, is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes?
And Jhesus clepide a litil child, and putte hym in the myddil of hem;
and seide, Y seie treuthe to you, but ye be turned, and maad as litle children, ye schulen not entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
Therfor who euer mekith hym as this litil child, he is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes.
And he that resseyueth o siche litil child in my name, resseyueth me.
But who so sclaundrith oon of these smale, that bileuen in me, it spedith to hym that a mylnstoon `of assis be hangid in his necke, and he be drenchid in the depnesse of the see.
Woo to the world, for sclaundris; for it is nede that sclaundris come; netheles wo to thilke man bi whom a sclaundre cometh.
And if thin hoond or thi foot sclaundreth thee, kitte it of, and caste awei fro thee. It is betere to thee to entre to lijf feble, ethir crokid, than hauynge tweyne hoondis or twey feet to be sent in to euerlastynge fier.
And if thin iye sclaundre thee, pulle it out, and caste awei fro thee. It is betere to thee with oon iye to entre in to lijf, thanne hauynge tweyn iyen to be sent in to the fier of helle.
Se ye, that ye dispise not oon of these litle. For Y seie to you, that the aungels of hem in heuenes seen euermore the face of my fadir that is in heuenes.
For mannus sone cam to saue that thing that perischide.
What semeth to you? If ther weren to sum man an hundrid scheep, and oon of hem hath errid, whethir he schal not leeue nynti and nyne in desert, and schal go to seche that that erride?
And if it falle that he fynde it, treuli Y seie to you, that he schal haue ioye theron more than on nynti and nyne that erriden not.
So it is not the wille bifor youre fadir that is in heuenes, that oon of these litle perische.
But if thi brother synneth ayens thee, go thou, and repreue hym, bitwixe thee and hym aloone; if he herith thee, thou hast wonnun thi brother.
And if he herith thee not, take with thee oon or tweyne, that euery word stonde in the mouth of tweyne or thre witnessis.
And if he herith not hem, seie thou to the chirche. But if he herith not the chirche, be he as an hethen and a pupplican to thee.
Y seie to you treuli, what euer thingis ye bynden on erthe, tho schulen be boundun also in heuene; and what euer thingis ye vnbynden on erthe, tho schulen be vnboundun also in heuene.
Eftsoone Y seie to you, that if tweyne of you consenten on the erthe, of euery thing what euer thei axen, it schal be don to hem of my fadir that is in heuenes.
For where tweyne or thre ben gaderid in my name, there Y am in the myddil of hem.
Thanne Petre cam to hym, and seide, Lord, how ofte schal my brother synne ayens me, and Y schal foryyue hym?
Whether til seuen tymes? Jhesus seith to hym, Y seie not to thee, til seuene sithis; but til seuenti sithis seuene sithis.
Therfor the kyngdom of heuenes is licned to a kyng, that wolde rekyn with hise seruauntis.
And whanne he bigan to rekene, oon that ouyte ten thousynde talentis, was brouyt to hym.
And whanne he hadde not wherof to yelde, his lord comaundide hym to be seld, and his wijf, and children, and alle thingis that he hadde, and to be paied.
But thilke seruaunt felde doun, and preiede hym, and seide, Haue pacience in me, and Y schal yelde to thee alle thingis.
And the lord hadde merci on that seruaunt, and suffride hym to go, and foryaf to hym the dette.
But thilke seruaunt yede out, and foonde oon of his euen seruauntis, that ouyte hym an hundrid pens; and he helde hym, and stranglide hym, and seide, Yelde that that thou owest.
And his euen seruaunt felle doun, and preyede hym, and seide, Haue pacience in me, and Y schal quyte alle thingis to thee.
But he wolde not; but wente out, and putte hym in to prisoun, til he paiede al the dette.
And hise euen seruauntis, seynge the thingis that weren don, soreweden greetli. And thei camen, and telden to her lord alle the thingis that weren don.
Thanne his lord clepide hym, and seide to hym, Wickid seruaunt, Y foryaf to thee al the dette, for thou preiedist me.
Therfor whether it bihouede not also thee to haue merci on thin euen seruaunt, as Y hadde merci on thee?
And his lord was wroth, and took hym to turmentouris, til he paiede al the dette.
So my fadir of heuene schal do to you, if ye foryyuen not euery man to his brother, of youre hertes.
And it was don, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, he passide fro Galilee, and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan.
And myche puple suede him, and he heelide hem there.
And Farisees camen to him, temptynge him, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf, for ony cause?
Which answeride, and seide to hem, Han ye not red, for he that made men at the bigynnyng, made hem male and female?
And he seide, For this thing a man schal leeue fadir and modir, and he schal draw to his wijf; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
And so thei ben not now tweyne, but o fleisch. Therfor a man departe not that thing that God hath ioyned.
Thei seien to hym, What thanne comaundide Moises, to yyue a libel of forsakyng, and to leeue of?
And he seide to hem, For Moises, for the hardnesse of youre herte, suffride you leeue youre wyues; but fro the bigynnyng it was not so.
And Y seie to you, that who euer leeueth his wijf, but for fornycacioun, and weddith another, doith letcherie; and he that weddith the forsakun wijf, doith letcherie.
His disciplis seien to him, If the cause of a man with a wijf is so, it spedith not to be weddid.
And he seide to hem, Not alle men taken this word; but to whiche it is youun.
For ther ben geldingis, whiche ben thus born of the modris wombe; and ther ben geldyngis, that ben maad of men; and there ben geldyngis, that han geldid hem silf, for the kyngdom of heuenes. He that may take, `take he.
Thanne litle children weren brouyte to hym, that he schulde putte hondis to hem, and preie.
And the disciplis blamyden hem. But Jhesus seide to hem, Suffre ye that litle children come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem; for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes.
And whanne he hadde put to hem hondis, he wente fro thennus.
And lo! oon cam, and seide to hym, Good maister, what good schal Y do, that Y haue euerlastynge lijf?
Which seith to hym, What axist thou me of good thing? There is o good God. But if thou wolt entre to lijf, kepe the comaundementis.
He seith to hym, Whiche? And Jhesus seide, Thou schalt not do mansleying, thou schalt not do auowtrie, thou schalt not do thefte, thou schalt not seie fals witnessying;
worschipe thi fadir and thi modir, and, thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf.
The yonge man seith to hym, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my youthe, what yit failith to me?
Jhesus seith to hym, If thou wolt be perfite, go, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene; and come, and sue me.
And whanne the yong man hadde herd these wordis, he wente awei sorewful, for he hadde many possessiouns.
And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis, Y seie to you treuthe, for a riche man of hard schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
And eftsoone Y seie to you, it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a needlis iye, thanne a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of heuens.
Whanne these thingis weren herd, the disciplis wondriden greetli, and seiden, Who thanne may be saaf?
Jhesus bihelde, and seide to hem, Anentis men this thing is impossible; but anentis God alle thingis ben possible.
Thanne Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Lo! we han forsake alle thingis, and we han suede thee; what thanne schal be to vs?
Jhesus seide to hem, Truli I seie to you, that ye that han forsake alle thingis, and han sued me, in the regeneracioun whanne mannus sone schal sitte in the sete of his maieste, ye schulen sitte on twelue setis, demynge the twelue kynredis of Israel.
And euery man that forsakith hous, britheren or sistren, fadir or modir, wijf ethir children, or feeldis, for my name, he schal take an hundrid foold, and schal welde euerlastynge lijf.
But manye schulen be, the firste the laste, and the laste the firste.
The kyngdom of heuenes is lijc to an housbonde man, that wente out first bi the morewe, to hire werk men in to his vyneyerd.
And whanne the couenaunt was maad with werk men, of a peny for the dai, he sente hem in to his vyneyerd.
And he yede out aboute the thridde our, and say othere stondynge idel in the chepyng.
And he seide to hem, Go ye also in to myn vynyerd, and that that schal be riytful, Y schal yyue to you.
And thei wenten forth. Eftsoones he wente out aboute the sixte our, and the nynthe, and dide in lijk maner.
But aboute the elleuenthe our he wente out, and foond other stondynge; and he seide to hem, What stonden ye idel here al dai?
Thei seien to him, For no man hath hirid vs. He seith to hem, Go ye also in to my vyneyerd.
And whanne euenyng was comun, the lord of the vyneyerd seith to his procuratoure, Clepe the werk men, and yelde to hem her hire, and bigynne thou at the laste til to the firste.
And so whanne thei weren comun, that camen aboute the elleuenthe our, also thei token eueryche of hem a peny.
But the firste camen, and demeden, that thei schulden take more, but thei token ech oon bi hem silf a peny;
and in the takyng grutchiden ayens the hosebonde man, and seiden,
These laste wrouyten oon our, and thou hast maad hem euen to vs, that han born the charge of the dai, and heete?
And he answeride to oon of hem, and seide, Freend, Y do thee noon wrong; whether thou hast not acordid with me for a peny?
Take thou that that is thin, and go; for Y wole yyue to this laste man, as to thee.
Whether it is not leueful to me to do that that Y wole? Whether thin iye is wickid, for Y am good?
So the laste schulen be the firste, and the firste the laste; `for many ben clepid, but fewe ben chosun.
And Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem, and took hise twelue disciplis in priuetee, and seide to hem, Lo!
we goon vp to Jerusalem, and mannus sone schal be bitakun to princis of prestis, and scribis; and thei schulen condempne him to deeth.
And thei schulen bitake hym to hethene men, for to be scorned, and scourgid, and crucified; and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
Thanne the modir of the sones of Zebedee cam to hym with hir sones, onourynge, and axynge sum thing of hym.
And he seide to hir, What wolt thou? She seith to hym, Seie that thes tweyne my sones sitte, oon at thi riythalf, and oon at thi lefthalf, in thi kyngdom.
Jhesus answeride, and seide, Ye witen not what ye axen. Moun ye drynke the cuppe which Y schal drynke? Thei seien to hym, We moun.
He seith to hem, Ye schulen drinke my cuppe; but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf, it is not myn to yyue to you; but to whiche it is maad redi of my fadir.
And the ten herynge, hadden indignacioun of the twei britheren.
But Jhesus clepide hem to hym, and seide, Ye witen, that princis of hethene men ben lordis of hem, and thei that ben gretter, vsen power on hem.
It schal not be so among you; but who euer wole be maad gretter among you, be he youre mynystre;
and who euer among you wole be the firste, he schal be youre seruaunt.
As mannus sone cam not to be seruyd, but to serue, and to yyue his lijf redempcioun for manye.
And whanne thei yeden out of Jerico, miche puple suede him.
And lo! twei blynde men saten bisydis the weie, and herden that Jhesus passide; and thei crieden, and seiden, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
And the puple blamede hem, that thei schulden be stille; and thei crieden the more, and seiden, Lord, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on vs.
And Jhesus stood, and clepide hem, and seide, What wolen ye, that Y do to you?
Thei seien to him, Lord, that oure iyen be opened.
And Jhesus hadde merci on hem, and touchide her iyen; and anoon thei sayen, and sueden him.
And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem, and cam to Bethfage, at the mount of Olyuete, thanne sente he his twei disciplis, and seide to hem,
Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you, and anoon ye schulen fynde an asse tied, and a colt with hir; vntien ye, and brynge to me.
And if ony man seie to you ony thing, seie ye, that the Lord hath nede to hem; and anoon he schal leeue hem.
Al this was doon, that that thing schulde be fulfillid, that was seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Seie ye to the douyter of Syon, Lo!
thi kyng cometh to thee, meke, sittynge on an asse, and a fole of an asse vnder yok.
And the disciplis yeden, and diden as Jhesus comaundide hem.
And thei brouyten an asse, and the fole, and leiden her clothis on hem, and maden hym sitte aboue.
And ful myche puple strewiden her clothis in the weie; othere kittiden braunchis of trees, and strewiden in the weie.
And the puple that wente bifore, and that sueden, crieden, and seiden, Osanna to the sone of Dauid; blessid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Osanna in hiy thingis.
And whanne he was entrid in to Jerusalem, al the citee was stirid, and seide, Who is this?
But the puple seide, This is Jhesus, the prophete, of Nazareth of Galilee.
And Jhesus entride in to the temple of God, and castide out of the temple alle that bouyten and solden; and he turnede vpsedoun the bordis of chaungeris, and the chayeris of men that solden culueris.
And he seith to hem, It is writun, Myn hous schal be clepid an hous of preier; but ye han maad it a denne of theues.
And blynde and crokid camen to hym in the temple, and he heelide hem.
But the princis of prestis and scribis, seynge the merueilouse thingis that he dide, and children criynge in the temple, and seiynge, Osanna to the sone of Dauid, hadden indignacioun,
and seiden to hym, Herist thou what these seien? And Jhesus seide to hem, Yhe; whether ye han neuer redde, That of the mouth of yonge children, and of soukynge childryn, thou hast maad perfit heriyng?
And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente forth out of the citee, in to Bethanye; and there he dwelte, and tauyte hem of the kyngdom of God.
But on the morowe, he, turnynge ayen in to the citee, hungride.
And he saye a fige tree bisidis the weie, and cam to it, and foond no thing ther ynne but leeues oneli. And he seide to it, Neuer fruyt come forth of thee, in to with outen eende, And anoon the fige tre was dried vp.
And disciplis `sawen, and wondriden, seiynge, Hou anoon it driede.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, if ye haue feith, and douten not, not oonli ye schulen do of the fige tree, but also if ye seyn to this hil, Take, and caste thee in to the see, it schal be don so.
And alle thingis what euere ye bileuynge schulen axe in preyer, ye schulen take.
And whanne he cam in to the temple, the princis of prestis and elder men of the puple camen to hym that tauyte, and seiden, In what power doist thou these thingis? and who yaf thee this power?
Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word, the which if ye tellen me, Y schal seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
Of whennys was the baptym of Joon; of heuene, or of men? And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf,
seiynge, If we seien of heuene, he schal seie to vs, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym? If we seien of men, we dreden the puple, for alle hadden Joon as a prophete.
And thei answeriden to Jhesu, and seiden, We witen not. And he seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
But what semeth to you? A man hadde twey sones; and he cam to the firste, and seide, Sone, go worche this dai in my vyneyerd.
And he answeride, and seide, Y nyle; but afterward he forthouyte, and wente forth.
But he cam to `the tother, and seide on lijk maner. And he answeride, and seide, Lord, Y go; and he wente not.
Who of the tweyne dide the fadris wille? Thei seien to hym, The firste. Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, for pupplicans and hooris schulen go bifor you `in to the kyngdom of God.
For Joon cam to you in the weie of riytwisnesse, and ye bileueden not to him; but pupplicans and hooris bileueden to hym. But ye sayn, and hadden no forthenkyng aftir, that ye bileueden to hym.
Here ye another parable. There was an hosebonde man, that plauntide a vynyerd, and heggide it aboute, and dalfe a presour ther ynne, and bildide a tour, and hiride it to erthe tilieris, and wente fer in pilgrimage.
But whanne the tyme of fruytis neiyede, he sente his seruauntis to the erthe tilieris, to take fruytis of it.
And the erthetilieris token his seruauntis, and beeten `the toon, thei slowen another, and thei stonyden another.
Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis, mo than the firste, and in lijk maner thei diden to hem.
And at the laste he sente his sone to hem, and seide, Thei schulen drede my sone.
But the erthe tilieris, seynge the sone, seiden with ynne hem silf, This is the eire; come ye, sle we hym, and we schulen haue his eritage.
And thei token, and castiden hym out of the vynyerd, and slowen hym.
Therfor whanne the lord of the vyneyerd schal come, what schal he do to thilke erthe tilieris?
Thei seien to hym, He schal leese yuele the yuele men, and he schal sette to hire his vyneyerd to othere erthetilieris, whyche schulen yelde to hym fruyt in her tymes.
Jhesus seith to hem, Redden ye neuer in scripturis, The stoon which bilderis repreueden, this is maad in to the heed of the corner? Of the Lord this thing is don, and it is merueilous bifor oure iyen.
Therfor Y seie to you, that the kyngdom of God schal be takun fro you, and shal be youun to a folc doynge fruytis of it.
And he that schal falle on this stoon, schal be brokun; but on whom it schal falle, it schal al tobrise hym.
And whanne the princes of prestis and Farisees hadden herd hise parablis, thei knewen that he seide of hem.
And thei souyten to holde hym, but thei dredden the puple, for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
And Jhesus answeride, and spak eftsoone in parablis to hem,
and seide, The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a kyng that made weddyngis to his sone.
And he sente hise seruauntis for to clepe men that weren bode to the weddyngis, and thei wolden not come.
Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis, and seide, Seie ye to the men that ben bode to the feeste, Lo! Y haue maad redi my meete, my bolis and my volatilis ben slayn, and alle thingis ben redy; come ye to the weddyngis.
But thei dispisiden, and wenten forth, oon in to his toun, anothir to his marchaundise.
But othere helden his seruauntis, and turmentiden hem, and slowen.
But the kyng, whanne he hadde herd, was wroth; and he sente hise oostis, and he distruyede tho manquelleris, and brente her citee.
Thanne he seide to hise seruauntis, The weddyngis ben redi, but thei that weren clepid to the feeste, weren not worthi.
Therfor go ye to the endis of weies, and whom euere ye fynden, clepe ye to the weddyngis.
And hise seruauntis yeden out in to weies, and gadriden togider alle that thei founden, good and yuele; and the bridale was fulfillid with men sittynge at the mete.
And the kyng entride, to se men sittynge at the mete; and he siye there a man not clothid with bride cloth.
And he seide to hym, Freend, hou entridist thou hidir with out bride clothis? And he was doumbe.
Thanne the kyng bad hise mynystris, Bynde hym bothe hondis and feet, and sende ye him in to vtmer derknessis; there schal be wepyng and grentyng of teeth.
For many ben clepid, but fewe ben chosun.
Thanne Farisees yeden awei, and token a counsel to take Jhesu in word.
And thei senden to hym her disciplis, with Erodians, and seien, Maister, we witen, that thou art sothefast, and thou techist in treuthe the weie of God, and thou chargist not of ony man, for thou biholdist not the persoone of men.
Therfor seie to vs, what it seemeth to thee. Is it leueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure, ether nay?
And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe the wickidnesse of hem, he seide, Ypocritis, what tempten ye me?
Schewe ye to me the prynte of the money. And thei brouyten to hym a peny.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Whos is this ymage, and the writyng aboue?
Thei seien to hym, The emperouris. Thanne he seide to hem, Therfor yelde ye to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperouris, and to God tho thingis that ben of God.
And thei herden, and wondriden; and thei leften hym, and wenten awey.
In that dai Saduceis, that seien there is no risyng ayen to lijf, camen to hym, and axiden him,
and seiden, Mayster, Moises seide, if ony man is deed, not hauynge a sone, that his brother wedde his wijf, and reise seed to his brothir.
And seuen britheren weren at vs; and the firste weddide a wijf, and is deed. And he hadde no seed, and lefte his wijf to his brother;
also the secounde, and the thridde, til to the seuenthe.
But the laste of alle, the woman is deed.
Also in the risyng ayen to lijf, whos wijf of the seuene schal sche be? for alle hadden hir.
Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Ye erren, `and ye knowen not scripturis, ne the vertu of God.
For in the rysyng ayen to lijf, nether thei schulen wedde, nethir schulen be weddid; but thei ben as the aungels of God in heuene.
And of the risyng ayen of deed men, `han ye not red, that is seid of the Lord, that seith to you,
Y am God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob? he is not God of deede men, but of lyuynge men.
And the puple herynge, wondriden in his techynge.
And Fariseis herden that he hadde put silence to Saduceis, and camen togidere.
And oon of hem, a techere of the lawe, axide Jhesu, and temptide him,
Maistir, which is a greet maundement in the lawe?
Jhesus seide to him, Thou schalt loue thi Lord God, of al thin herte, and in al thi soule, and in al thi mynde.
This is the firste and the moste maundement.
And the secounde is lijk to this; Thou schalt loue thi neiyebore as thi silf.
In these twey maundementis hangith al the lawe and the profetis.
And whanne the Farisees weren gederid togidere, Jhesus axide hem,
and seide, What semeth to you of Crist, whos sone is he? Thei seien to hym, Of Dauid.
He seith to hem, Hou thanne Dauid in spirit clepith hym Lord,
and seith, The Lord seide to my Lord, Sitte on my riythalf, til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?
Thanne if Dauid clepith hym Lord, hou is he his sone?
And no man miyte answere a word to hym, nethir ony man was hardi fro that day, to axe hym more.
Thanne Jhesus spac to the puple, and to hise disciplis,
and seide, On the chayere of Moises, scribis and Farisees han sete.
Therfor kepe ye, and do ye alle thingis, what euer thingis thei seien to you. But nyle ye do aftir her werkis; for thei seien, and don not.
And thei bynden greuouse chargis, and that moun not be borun, and putten on schuldris of men; but with her fyngur thei wolen not moue hem.
Therfor thei don alle her werkis `that thei be seen of men; for thei drawen abrood her filateries, and magnifien hemmes.
And thei louen the first sittyng placis in soperis, and the first chaieris in synagogis;
and salutaciouns in chepyng, and to be clepid of men maystir.
But nyle ye be clepid maister; for oon is youre maystir, and alle ye ben britheren.
And nyle ye clepe to you a fadir on erthe, for oon is your fadir, that is in heuenes.
Nether be ye clepid maistris, for oon is youre maister, Crist.
He that is grettest among you, schal be youre mynystre.
For he that hieth himself, schal be mekid; and he that mekith hym silf, schal be enhaunsid.
But wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that closen the kyngdom of heuenes bifore men; and ye entren not, nether suffren men entrynge to entre.
Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that eten the housis of widowis, and preien bi longe preier; for this thing ye schulen take more doom.
Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that goon aboute the see and the loond, to make o prosilite; and whanne he is maad, ye maken hym a sone of helle, double more than ye ben.
Wo to you, blynde lederis, that seien, Who euer swerith bi the temple of God, it is `no thing; but he that swerith in the gold of the temple, is dettoure.
Ye foolis and blynde, for what is grettere, the gold, or the temple that halewith the gold?
And who euer swerith in the auter, it is no thing; but he that swerith in the yifte that is on the auter, owith.
Blynde men, for what is more, the yifte, or the auter that halewith the yifte?
Therfor he that swerith in the auter, swerith in it, and in alle thingis that ben ther on.
And he that swerith in the temple, swerith in it, and in hym that dwellith in the temple.
And he that swerith in heuene, swerith in the trone of God, and in hym that sittith ther on.
Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that tithen mynte, anete, and cummyn, and han left tho thingis that ben of more charge of the lawe, doom, and merci, and feith. And it bihofte to do these thingis, and not to leeue tho.
Blynde lederis, clensinge a gnatte, but swolewynge a camel.
Woo to you, scribis and Farisees, ypocritis, that clensen the cuppe and the plater with outforth; but with ynne ye ben ful of raueyne and vnclennesse.
Thou blynde Farisee, clense the cuppe and the plater with ynneforth, that that that is with outforth be maad clene.
Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that ben lijk to sepulcris whitid, whiche with outforth semen faire to men; but with ynne thei ben fulle of boonus of deed men, and of al filthe.
So ye with outforth semen iust to men; but with ynne ye ben ful of ypocrisy and wickidnesse.
Wo to you, scribis and Farisees, ipocritis, that bilden sepulcris of profetis, and maken faire the birielis of iust men,
and seien, If we hadden be in the daies of oure fadris, we schulden not haue be her felowis in the blood of prophetis.
And so ye ben in witnessyng to you silf, that ye ben the sones of hem that slowen the prophetis.
And fulfille ye the mesure of youre fadris.
Ye eddris, and eddris briddis, hou schulen ye fle fro the doom of helle?
Therfor lo! Y sende to you profetis, and wise men, and scribis; and of hem ye schulen sle and crucifie, and of hem ye schulen scourge in youre sinagogis, and schulen pursue fro cite in to citee;
that al the iust blood come on you, that was sched on the erthe, fro the blood of iust Abel to the blood of Zacarie, the sone of Barachie, whom ye slowen bitwixe the temple and the auter.
Treuli Y seie to you, alle these thingis schulen come on this generacioun.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that sleest prophetis, and stoonest hem that ben sent to thee, hou ofte wolde Y gadere togidere thi children, as an henne gaderith togidir her chikenes vndir hir wengis, and thou woldist not.
Lo! youre hous schal be left to you desert.
And Y seie to you, ye schulen not se me fro hennus forth, til ye seien, Blessid is he, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
And Jhesus wente out of the temple; and his disciplis camen to hym, to schewe hym the bildyngis of the temple.
But he answeride, and seide to hem, Seen ye alle these thingis? Treuli Y seie to you, a stoon schal not be left here on a stoon, that ne it schal be destried.
And whanne he satte on the hille of Olyuete, hise disciplis camen to hym priueli, and seiden, Seie vs, whanne these thingis schulen be, and what token of thi comyng, and of the ending of the world.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Loke ye, that no man disseyue you.
For many schulen come in my name, and schulen seie, Y am Crist; and thei schulen disseyue manye.
For ye schulen here batels, and opyniouns of batels; se ye that ye be not disturblid; for it byhoueth these thingis to be don, but not yit is the ende.
Folk schal rise togidere ayens folc, and rewme ayens rewme, and pestilences, and hungris, and the erthemouyngis schulen be bi placis;
and alle these ben bigynnyngis of sorewes.
Thanne men schulen bitake you in to tribulacion, and schulen sle you, and ye schulen be in hate to alle folk for my name.
And thanne many schulen be sclaundrid, and bitraye ech other, and thei schulen hate ech other.
And many false prophetis schulen rise, and disseyue manye.
And for wickidnesse schal `be plenteuouse, the charite of manye schal wexe coold;
but he that schal dwelle stable in to the ende, schal be saaf.
And this gospel of the kyngdom schal be prechid in al the world, in witnessyng to al folc;
and thanne the ende schal come. Therfor whanne ye se the abhomynacioun of discomfort, that is seid of Danyel, the prophete, stondynge in the hooli place; he that redith, vndirstonde he;
thanne thei that ben in Judee, fle to the mounteyns; and he that is in the hous roof,
come not doun to take ony thing of his hous; and he that is in the feeld,
turne not ayen to take his coote.
But wo to hem that ben with child, and nurischen in tho daies.
Preye ye, that youre fleyng be not maad in wynter, or in the saboth.
For thanne schal be greet tribulacioun, what maner `was not fro the bigynnyng of the world to now, nether schal be maad.
And but tho daies hadden be abreggide, ech flesch schulde not be maad saaf; but tho daies schulen be maad schort, for the chosun men.
Thanne if ony man seie to you, Lo! here is Crist, or there, nyle ye bileue.
For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise, and thei schulen yyue grete tokenes and wondrys; so that also the chosun be led in to erroure, if it may be done.
Lo! Y haue bifor seid to you.
Therfor if thei seie to you, Lo! he is in desert, nyle ye go out; lo! in priuey placis, nyle ye trowe.
For as leit goith out fro the eest, and apperith in to the weste, so schal be also the coming of mannus sone.
Where euer the bodi schal be, also the eglis schulen be gaderid thidur.
And anoon after the tribulacioun of tho daies, the sunne schal be maad derk, and the moone schal not yyue hir liyt, and the sterris schulen falle fro heuene, and the vertues of heuenes schulen be moued.
And thanne the tokene of mannus sone schal appere in heuene, and thanne alle kynredis of the erthe schulen weile; and thei schulen see mannus sone comynge in the cloudis of heuene, with miche vertu and maieste.
And he schal sende hise aungels with a trumpe, and a greet vois; and thei schulen gedere hise chosun fro foure wyndis, fro the hiyest thingis of heuenes to the endis of hem.
And lerne ye the parable of a fige tre. Whanne his braunche is now tendir, and the leeues ben sprongun, ye witen that somer is nyy;
`so and ye whanne ye seen alle these thingis, wite ye that it is nyy, in the yatis.
Treuli Y seie to you, for this generacioun schal not passe, til alle thingis be don;
heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
But of thilke dai and our no man wote, nethir aungels of heuenes, but the fadir aloone.
But as it was in the daies of Noe, so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
For as in the daies bifore the greet flood, thei weren etynge and drynkynge, weddynge and takynge to weddyng, to that dai, that Noe entride in to the schippe;
and thei knewen not, til the greet flood cam, and took alle men, so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
Thanne tweyne schulen be in o feeld, oon schal be takun, and another left;
twey wymmen schulen be gryndynge in o queerne, oon schal be takun, and `the tother left; tweyn in a bedde, `the toon schal be takun, and the tother left.
Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not in what our the Lord schal come.
But wite ye this, that if the hosebonde man wiste in what our the thefe were to come, certis he wolde wake, and suffre not his hous to be vndurmyned.
And therfor be ye redi, for in what our ye gessen not, mannus sone schal come.
Who gessist thou is a trewe seruaunt and prudent, whom his lord ordeyned on his meynee, to yyue hem mete in tyme?
Blessed is that seruaunt, whom `his lord, whanne he schal come, schal fynde so doynge.
Treuli Y seye to you, for on alle his goodis he schal ordeyne hym.
But if thilke yuel seruaunt seie in his herte, My lord tarieth to come,
and bigynneth to smyte hise euen seruauntis, and ete, and drynke with drunken men;
the lord of that seruaunt schal come in the dai which he hopith not, and in the our that he knowith not,
and schal departe hym, and putte his part with ypocritis; there schal be wepyng, and gryntyng of teeth.
Thanne the kyngdoom of heuenes schal be lijk to ten virgyns, whiche token her laumpis, and wenten out ayens the hosebonde and the wijf;
and fyue of hem weren foolis, and fyue prudent.
But the fyue foolis token her laumpis, and token not oile with hem;
but the prudent token oile in her vessels with the laumpis.
And whilis the hosebonde tariede, alle thei nappiden and slepten.
But at mydnyyt a cryy was maad, Lo! the spouse cometh, go ye oute to mete with him.
Thanne alle tho virgyns risen vp, and araieden her laumpis.
And the foolis seiden to the wise, Yyue ye to vs of youre oile, for oure laumpis ben quenchid.
The prudent answeriden, and seiden, Lest perauenture it suffice not to vs and to you, go ye rather to men that sellen, and bie to you.
And while thei wenten for to bie, the spouse cam; and tho that weren redi, entreden with him to the weddyngis; and the yate was schit.
And at the last the othere virgyns camen, and seiden, Lord, lord, opene to vs.
And he answeride, and seide, Treuli Y seie to you, Y knowe you not.
Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not the dai ne the our.
For as a man that goith in pilgrimage, clepide hise seruauntis, and bitook to hem hise goodis;
and to oon he yaf fyue talentis, and to another tweyne, and to another oon, to ech after his owne vertu; and wente forth anoon.
And he that hadde fyue besauntis, wente forth, and wrouyte in hem, and wan othere fyue.
Also and he that hadde takun tweyne, wan othere tweyne.
But he that hadde takun oon, yede forth, and dalf in to the erthe, and hidde the money of his lord.
But after long tyme, the lord of tho seruauntis cam, and rekenede with hem.
And he that hadde takun fyue besauntis, cam, and brouyte othere fyue, and seide, Lord, thou bytokist to me fyue besauntis, loo! Y haue getun aboue fyue othere.
His lord seide to hym, Wel be thou, good seruaunt and feithful; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe, Y schal ordeyne thee on manye thingis; entre thou in to the ioye of thi lord.
And he that hadde takun twey talentis, cam, and seide, Lord, thou bitokist to me twey besauntis; loo!
Y haue wonnen ouer othir tweyne. His lord seide to him, Wel be thou, good seruaunt and trewe; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe, Y schal ordeyne thee on many thingis; entre thou in to the ioie of thi lord.
But he that hadde takun o besaunt, cam, and seide, Lord, Y woot that thou art an hard man; thou repist where thou hast not sowe, and thou gederist togidere where thou hast not spred abrood;
and Y dredynge wente, and hidde thi besaunt in the erthe; lo! thou hast that that is thin.
His lord answeride, and seide to hym, Yuel seruaunt and slowe, wistist thou that Y repe where Y sewe not, and gadir to gidere where Y spredde not abrood?
Therfor it bihofte thee to bitake my money to chaungeris, that whanne Y cam, Y schulde resseyue that that is myn with vsuris.
Therfor take awei fro hym the besaunt, and yyue ye to hym that hath ten besauntis.
For to euery man that hath me schal yyue, and he schal encreese; but fro hym that hath not, also that that hym semeth to haue, schal be taken awey fro him.
And caste ye out the vnprofitable seruaunt in to vtmer derknessis; ther schal be wepyng, and gryntyng of teeth.
Whanne mannus sone schal come in his maieste, and alle hise aungels with hym, thanne he schal sitte on the sege of his maieste;
and alle folkis schulen be gaderid bifor hym,
and he schal departe hem atwynne, as a scheeperde departith scheep from kidis; and he schal sette the scheep on his riythalf, and the kidis on the lefthalf.
Thanne the kyng schal seie to hem, that schulen be on his riythalf, Come ye, the blessid of my fadir, take ye in possessioun the kyngdoom maad redi to you fro the makyng of the world.
For Y hungride, and ye yauen me to ete; Y thristide, and ye yauen me to drynke; Y was herboreles, and ye herboriden me;
nakid, and ye hiliden me; sijk, and ye visitiden me; Y was in prisoun, and ye camen to me.
Thanne iust men schulen answere to hym, and seie, Lord, whanne siyen we thee hungry, and we fedden thee; thristi, and we yauen to thee drynk?
and whanne sayn we thee herborles, and we herboreden thee; or nakid, and we hiliden thee?
or whanne sayn we thee sijk, or in prisoun, and we camen to thee?
And the kyng answerynge schal seie to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, as longe as ye diden to oon of these my leeste britheren, ye diden to me.
Thanne the kyng schal seie also to hem, that schulen be on his lefthalf, Departe fro me, ye cursid, in to euerlastynge fijr, that is maad redi to the deuel and hise aungels.
For Y hungride, and ye yauen not me to ete; Y thristide, and ye yauen not me to drynke;
Y was herborles, and ye herberden not me; nakid, and ye keuerden not me; sijk, and in prisoun, and ye visitiden not me.
Thanne and thei schulen answere to hym, and schulen seie, Lord, whanne sayn we thee hungrynge, or thristynge, or herboreles, or nakid, or sijk, or in prisoun, and we serueden not to thee?
Thanne he schal answere to hem, and seie, Treuli Y seie to you, `hou longe ye diden not to oon of these leeste, nether ye diden to me.
And these schulen goo in to euerlastynge turment; but the iust men schulen go in to euerlastynge lijf.
And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid alle these wordis, he seide to hise disciplis,
Ye witen, that aftir twei daies pask schal be maad, and mannus sone schal be bitakun to be crucified.
Than the princes of prestis and the elder men of the puple were gaderid in to the halle of the prince of prestis, that was seid Cayfas,
and maden a counsel to holde Jhesu with gile, and sle him;
but thei seiden, Not in the haliday, lest perauenture noyse were maad in the puple.
And whanne Jhesus was in Betanye, in the hous of Symount leprous,
a womman that hadde a box of alabastre of precious oynement, cam to hym, and schedde out on the heed of hym restynge.
And disciplis seynge hadden dedeyn, and seiden, Wherto this loss? for it myyte be seld for myche,
and be youun to pore men.
But Jhesus knewe, and seide to hem, What ben ye heuy to this womman? for sche hath wrouyt in me a good werk.
For ye schulen euere haue pore men with you, but ye schulen not algatis haue me.
This womman sendynge this oynement in to my bodi, dide to birie me.
Treuli Y seie to you, where euer this gospel schal be prechid in al the world, it schal be seid, that sche dide this, in mynde of hym.
Thanne oon of the twelue, that was clepid Judas Scarioth, wente forth to the princis of prestis,
and seide to hem, What wolen ye yyue to me, and Y schal bitake hym to you? And thei ordeyneden to hym thretti pans of siluer.
And fro that tyme he souyte oportunyte, to bitraye hym.
And in the firste dai of therf looues the disciplis camen to Jhesu, and seiden, Where wolt thou we make redi to thee, to ete paske?
Jhesus seide, Go ye into the citee to `sum man, and seie to hym, The maistir seith, My tyme is nyy; at thee Y make paske with my disciplis.
And the disciplis diden, as Jhesus comaundide to hem; and thei maden the paske redi.
And whanne euentid was come, he sat to mete with hise twelue disciplis.
And he seide to hem, as thei eten, Treuli Y seie to you, that oon of you schal bitraye me.
And thei ful sori bigunnen ech bi hym silf to seie, Lord, whether `Y am?
And he answeride, and seide, He that puttith with me his hoond in the plater, schal bitraye me.
Forsothe mannus sone goith, as it is writun of hym; but wo to that man, bi whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed; it were good to hym, if that man hadde not be borun.
But Judas that bitraiede hym, answeride, seiynge, Maister, whether `Y am? Jhesus seide to hym, Thou hast seid.
And while thei soupeden, Jhesus took breed, and blesside, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis, and seide, Take ye, and ete; this is my body.
And he took the cuppe, and dide thankyngis, and yaf to hem,
and seide, Drynke ye alle herof; this is my blood of the newe testament, which schal be sched for many, in to remissioun of synnes.
And Y seie to you, Y schal not drynke fro this tyme, of this fruyt of the vyne, in to that dai whanne Y schal drynke it newe with you, in the kyngdom of my fadir.
And whanne the ympne was seid, thei wenten out in to the mount of Olyuete.
Thanne Jhesus seide to hem, Alle ye schulen suffre sclaundre in me, in this niyt; for it is writun, Y schal smyte the scheeperde, and the scheep of the flok schulen be scaterid.
But aftir that Y schal rise ayen, Y schal go bifore you in to Galilee.
Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid in thee, Y schal neuer be sclaundrid.
Jhesus seide to him, Treuli Y seie to thee, for in this nyyt bifor the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me.
Peter seide to him, Yhe, thouy it bihoue that Y die with thee, Y schal not denye thee. Also alle the disciplis seiden.
Thanne Jhesus cam with hem in to a toun, that is seid Jessamanye. And he seide to his disciplis, Sitte ye here, the while Y go thider, and preye.
And whanne he hadde take Peter, and twei sones of Zebedee, he bigan to be heuy and sori.
Thanne he seide to hem, My soule is soreuful to the deeth; abide ye here, and wake ye with me.
And he yede forth a litil, and felde doun on his face, preiynge, and seiynge, My fader, if it is possible, passe this cuppe fro me; netheles not as Y wole, but as thou wolt.
And he cam to his disciplis, and foond hem slepynge. And he seide to Petir, So, whethir ye myyten not oon our wake with me?
Wake ye, and preye ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun; for the spirit is redi, but the fleisch is sijk.
Eft the secounde tyme he wente, and preyede, seiynge, My fadir, if this cuppe may not passe, but Y drynke hym, thi wille be doon.
And eftsoone he cam, and foond hem slepynge; for her iyen weren heuyed.
And he lefte hem, and wente eftsoone, and preiede the thridde tyme, and seide the same word.
Thanne he cam to his disciplis, and seide to hem, Slepe ye now, and reste ye; loo! the our hath neiyed, and mannus sone schal be takun in to the hondis of synneris;
rise ye, go we; loo! he that schal take me, is nyy.
Yit the while he spak, lo! Judas, oon of the twelue, cam, and with hym a greet cumpeny, with swerdis and battis, sent fro the princis of prestis, and fro the eldre men of the puple.
And he that bitraiede hym, yaf to hem a tokene, and seide, Whom euer Y schal kisse, he it is; holde ye hym.
And anoon he cam to Jhesu, and seid, Haile, maister;
and he kisside hym. And Jhesus seide to hym, Freend, wherto art thou comun? Thanne thei camen niy, and leiden hoondis on Jhesu, and helden hym.
And lo! oon of hem that weren with Jhesu, streiyte out his hoond, and drouy out his swerd; and he smoot the seruaunt of the prince of prestis, and kitte of his ere.
Thanne Jhesus seide to hym, Turne thi swerd in to his place; for alle that taken swerd, schulen perische bi swerd.
Whether gessist thou, that Y may not preie my fadir, and he schal yyue to me now mo than twelue legiouns of aungels?
Hou thanne schulen the scriptures be fulfilled? for so it bihoueth to be doon.
In that our Jhesus seide to the puple, As to a theef ye han gon out, with swerdis and battis, to take me; dai bi dai Y sat among you, and tauyt in the temple, and ye helden me not.
But al this thing was don, that the scripturis of profetis schulden be fulfillid. Thanne alle the disciplis fledden, and leften hym.
And thei helden Jhesu, and ledden hym to Cayfas, the prince of prestis, where the scribis and the Farisees, and the eldre men of the puple weren comun togidere.
But Petir swede him afer, in to the halle of the prince of prestis; and he wente in, and sat with the seruauntis, to se the ende.
And the prince of prestis, and al the counsel souyten fals witnessing ayens Jhesu, that thei schulden take hym to deeth;
and thei founden not, whanne manye false witnessis weren comun. But at the laste, twei false witnessis camen,
and seiden, `This seide, Y may distruye the temple of God, and after the thridde dai bilde it ayen.
And the prince of prestis roos, and seide to hym, Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis, that these witnessen ayens thee?
But Jhesus was stille. And the prince of prestis seide to hym, Y coniure thee bi lyuynge God, that thou seie to vs, if thou art Crist, the sone of God.
Jhesus seide to him, Thou hast seid; netheles Y seie to you, `fro hennus forth ye schulen se mannus sone sittinge at the riythalf of the vertu of God, and comynge in the cloudis of heuene.
Thanne the prince of prestis to-rente his clothis, and seide, He hath blasfemed; what yit han we nede to witnessis? lo! now ye han herd blasfemye; what semeth to you?
And thei answeriden, and seiden, He is gilti of deeth.
Thanne thei speten `in to his face, and smyten hym with buffatis; and othere yauen strokis with the pawme of her hondis in his face,
and seide, Thou Crist, arede to vs, who is he that smoot thee?
And Petir sat with outen in the halle; and a damysel cam to hym, and seide, Thou were with Jhesu of Galilee.
And he denyede bifor alle men, and seide, Y woot not what thou seist.
And whanne he yede out at the yate, another damysel say hym, and seide to hem that weren there, And this was with Jhesu of Nazareth.
And eftsoone he denyede with an ooth, For I knewe not the man.
And a litil aftir, thei that stooden camen, and seiden to Petir, Treuli thou art of hem; for thi speche makith thee knowun.
Thanne he bigan to warie and to swere, that he knewe not the man. And anoon the cok crewe.
And Petir bithouyte on the word of Jhesu, that he hadde seid, Bifore the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me. And he yede out, and wepte bitterli.
But whanne the morowtid was comun, alle the princis of prestis, and the eldre men of the puple token counsel ayens Jhesu, that thei schulden take hym to the deeth.
And thei ledden him boundun, and bitoken to Pilat of Pounce, iustice.
Thanne Judas that bitraiede hym, say that he was dampned, he repentide, and brouyte ayen the thretti pans to the princis of prestis, and to the elder men of the puple,
and seide, Y haue synned, bitraiynge riytful blood. And thei seiden, What to vs? bise thee.
And whanne he hadde cast forth the siluer in the temple, he passide forth, and yede, and hongide hym silf with a snare.
And the princis of prestis token the siluer, and seide, It is not leueful to putte it in to the treserie, for it is the prijs of blood.
And whanne thei hadden take counsel, thei bouyten with it a feeld of a potter, in to biryyng of pilgrymys.
Herfor thilke feeld is clepid Acheldemac, that is, a feeld of blood, in to this dai.
Thanne that was fulfillid, that was seid bi the prophete Jeremye, seiynge, And thei han takun thretti pans, the prijs of a man preysid, whom thei preiseden of the children of Israel;
and thei yauen hem in to a feeld of a potter, as the Lord hath ordenyd to me.
And Jhesus stood bifor the domesman; and the iustice axide him, and seide, Art thou king of Jewis?
Jhesus seith to hym, Thou seist. And whanne he was accusid of the princis of prestis, and of the eldere men of the puple, he answeride no thing.
Thanne Pilat seith to him, Herist thou not, hou many witnessyngis thei seien ayens thee?
And he answeride not `to hym ony word, so that the iustice wondride greetli.
But for a solempne dai the iustice was wont to delyuere to the puple oon boundun, whom thei wolden.
And he hadde tho a famous man boundun, that was seid Barrabas.
Therfor Pilate seide to hem, whanne thei weren to gidere, Whom wolen ye, that Y delyuere to you? whether Barabas, or Jhesu, that is seid Crist?
For he wiste, that bi enuye thei bitraieden hym.
And while he sat for domesman, his wijf sente to hym, and seide, No thing to thee and to that iust man; for Y haue suffrid this dai many thingis for hym, bi a visioun.
Forsothe the prince of prestis, and the eldere men counseiliden the puple, that thei schulden axe Barabas, but thei schulden distrye Jhesu.
But the iustice answeride, and seide to hem, Whom of the tweyn wolen ye, that be delyuerit to you? And thei seiden, Barabas.
Pilat seith to hem, What thanne schal Y do of Jhesu, that is seid Crist?
Alle seien, `Be he crucified. The iustice seith to hem, What yuel hath he doon? And thei crieden more, and seiden, Be he crucified.
And Pilat seynge that he profitide no thing, but that the more noyse was maad, took watir, and waischide hise hondis bifor the puple, and seide, Y am giltles of the blood of this riytful man; bise you.
And al the puple answeride, and seide, His blood be on vs, and on oure children.
Thanne he deliuerede to hem Barabas, but he took to hem Jhesu scourgid, to be crucified.
Thanne knyytis of the iustice token Jhesu in the moot halle, and gadriden to hym al the cumpeny `of knyytis.
And thei vnclothiden hym, and diden aboute hym a reed mantil;
and thei foldiden a coroun of thornes, and putten on his heed, and a rehed in his riyt hoond; and thei kneliden bifore hym, and scornyden hym, and seiden, Heil, kyng of Jewis.
And thei speten on hym, and tooken a rehed, and smoot his heed.
And aftir that thei hadden scorned him, thei vnclothiden hym of the mantil, and thei clothiden hym with hise clothis, and ledden hym to `crucifien hym.
And as thei yeden out, thei founden a man of Cirenen comynge fro the toun, Symont bi name; thei constreyneden hym to take his cross.
And thei camen in to a place that is clepid Golgatha, that is, the place of Caluarie.
And thei yauen hym to drynke wyne meynd with galle; and whanne he hadde tastid, he wolde not drynke.
And aftir that thei hadden crucified hym, thei departiden his clothis, and kesten lotte, to fulfille that is seid bi the prophete, seiynge, Thei partiden to hem my clothis, and on my clooth thei kesten lott.
And thei seten, and kepten him;
and setten aboue his heed his cause writun, This is Jhesu of Nazareth, kyng of Jewis.
Thanne twey theues weren crucified with hym, oon on the riythalf, and oon on the lefthalf.
And men that passiden forth blasfemeden hym,
mouynge her heedis, and seiynge, Vath to thee, that distriest the temple of God, and in the thridde dai bildist it ayen; saue thou thi silf; if thou art the sone of God, come doun of the cross.
Also and princis of prestis scornynge, with scribis and elder men,
seiden, He made othere men saaf, he may not make hym silf saaf; if he is kyng of Israel, come he now doun fro the crosse, and we bileuen to hym;
he tristide in God; delyuer he hym now, if he wole; for he seide, That Y am Goddis sone.
And the theues, that weren crucified with hym, vpbreididen hym of the same thing.
But fro the sixte our derknessis weren maad on al the erthe, to the nynthe our.
And aboute the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois, and seide, Heli, Heli, lamazabatany, that is, My God, my God, whi hast thou forsake me?
And summen that stoden there, and herynge, seiden, This clepith Helye.
And anoon oon of hem rennynge, took and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide on a rehed, and yaf to hym to drynke.
But othir seiden, Suffre thou; se we whether Helie come to deliuer hym.
Forsothe Jhesus eftsoone criede with a greet voyce, and yaf vp the goost.
And lo! the veil of the temple was to-rent in twey parties, fro the hiest to the lowest. And the erthe schoke, and stoonus weren cloue; and birielis weren openyd,
and many bodies of seyntis that hadden slepte, rysen vp.
And thei yeden out of her birielis, and aftir his resurreccioun thei camen in to the holi citee, and apperiden to many.
And the centurien and thei that weren with hym kepinge Jhesu, whanne thei saien the erthe schakynge, and tho thingis that weren doon, thei dredden greetli,
and seiden, Verili this was Goddis sone. And ther weren there many wymmen afer, that sueden Jhesu fro Galilee, and mynystriden to hym.
Among whiche was Marie Magdalene, and Marie, the modir of James, and of Joseph, and the modir of Zebedees sones.
But whanne the euenyng was come, ther cam a riche man of Armathi, Joseph bi name, and he was a disciple of Jhesu.
He wente to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu.
Thanne Pilat comaundide the bodie to be youun. And whanne the bodi was takun, Joseph lappide it in a clene sendel,
and leide it in his newe biriel, that he hadde hewun in a stoon; and he walewide a greet stoon to the dore of the biriel, and wente awei.
But Marie Maudelene and anothir Marie weren there, sittynge ayens the sepulcre.
And on `the tother dai, that is aftir pask euen, the princis of prestis and the Farisees camen togidere to Pilat,
and seiden, Sir, we han mynde, that thilke giloure seide yit lyuynge, Aftir thre daies Y schal rise ayen to lijf.
Therfor comaunde thou, that the sepulcre be kept in to the thridde dai; lest hise disciplis comen, and stelen hym, and seie to the puple, He hath rise fro deeth; and the laste errour schal be worse than the formere.
Pilat seide to hem, Ye han the kepyng; go ye, kepe ye as ye kunnen.
And thei yeden forth, and kepten the sepulcre, markynge the stoon, with keperis.
But in the euentid of the sabat, that bigynneth to schyne in the firste dai of the woke, Marie Mawdelene cam, and another Marie, to se the sepulcre.
And lo! ther was maad a greet ertheschakyng; for the aungel of the Lord cam doun fro heuene, and neiyede, and turnede awei the stoon, and sat theron.
And his lokyng was as leit, and hise clothis as snowe;
and for drede of hym the keperis weren afeerd, and thei weren maad as deede men.
But the aungel answeride, and seide to the wymmen, Nyle ye drede, for Y woot that ye seken Jhesu, that was crucified;
he is not here, for he is risun, as he seide; come ye, and se ye the place, where the Lord was leid.
And go ye soone, and seie ye to his disciplis, that he is risun. And lo! he schal go bifore you in to Galilee; there ye schulen se hym.
Lo! Y haue biforseid to you. And thei wenten out soone fro the biriels, with drede and greet ioye, rennynge to telle to hise disciplis.
And lo! Jhesus mette hem, and seide, Heile ye. And thei neiyeden, and heelden his feet, and worschipiden him.
Thanne Jhesus seide to hem, Nyle ye drede; go ye, `telle ye to my britheren, that thei go in to Galile; there thei schulen se me.
And whanne thei weren goon, lo! summe of the keperis camen in to the citee, and telden to the princis of prestis alle thingis that weren doon.
And whanne thei weren gaderid togidere with the elder men, and hadden take her counseil, thei yauen to the kniytis miche monei, and seiden, Seie ye,
that hise disciplis camen bi nyyt, and han stolen hym, while ye slepten.
And if this be herd of the iustice, we schulen counseile hym, and make you sikir.
And whanne the monei was takun, thei diden, as thei weren tauyt. And this word is pupplischid among the Jewis, til in to this day.
And the enleuen disciplis wenten in to Galilee, in to an hille, where Jhesus hadde ordeyned to hem.
And thei sayn hym, and worschipiden; but summe of hem doutiden.
And Jhesus cam nyy, and spak to hem, and seide, Al power in heuene and in erthe is youun to me.
Therfor go ye, and teche alle folkis, baptisynge hem in the name of the Fadir, and of the Sone, and of the Hooli Goost;
techynge hem to kepe alle thingis, what euer thingis Y haue comaundid to you; and lo! Y am with you in alle daies, in to the ende of the world.
The bigynnyng of the gospel of Jhesu Crist, the sone of God.
As it is writun in Ysaie, the prophete, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, that schal make thi weie redi bifor thee.
The vois of a crier in desert, Make ye redi the weie of the Lord, make ye hise paththis riyt.
Joon was in desert baptisynge, and prechynge the baptym of penaunce, in to remissioun of synnes.
And al the cuntre of Judee wente out to hym, and alle men of Jerusalem; and thei weren baptisid of hym in the flom Jordan, `and knoulechiden her synnes.
And Joon was clothid with heeris of camels, and a girdil of skyn was about hise leendis; and he ete hony soukis, and wilde hony, and prechide,
and seide, A stronger than Y schal come aftir me, and Y am not worthi to knele doun, and vnlace his schoone.
Y haue baptisid you in watir; but he schal baptise you in the Hooli Goost.
And it was don in tho daies, Jhesus cam fro Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptisid of Joon in Jordan.
And anoon he wente up of the watir, and saye heuenes opened, and the Hooli Goost comynge doun as a culuer, and dwellynge in hym.
And a vois was maad fro heuenes, Thou art my loued sone, in thee Y am plesid.
And anoon the Spirit puttide hym forth in to deseert.
And he was in deseert fourti daies and fourti nyytis, and was temptid of Sathanas, and he was with beestis, and aungels mynystriden to hym.
But aftir that Joon was takun, Jhesus cam in to Galilee, and prechide the gospel of the kyngdoom of God,
and seide, That the tyme is fulfillid, and the kyngdoom of God schal come nyy; do ye penaunce, and bileue ye to the gospel.
And as he passide bisidis the see of Galilee, he say Symount, and Andrew, his brother, castynge her nettis in to the see; for thei weren fisscheris.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Come ye aftir me; Y schal make you to be maad fisscheris of men.
And anoon thei leften the nettis, and sueden hym.
And he yede forth fro thennus a litil, and siy James of Zebedee, and Joon, his brother, in a boot makynge nettis.
And anoon he clepide hem; and thei leften Zebedee, her fadir, in the boot with hiryd seruauntis, and thei suweden hym.
And thei entriden in to Capharnaum, and anoon in the sabatys he yede in to a synagoge, and tauyte hem.
And thei wondriden on his teching; for he tauyte hem, as he that hadde power, and not as scribis.
And in the synagoge of hem was a man in an vnclene spirit, and he criede out,
and seide, What to vs and to thee, thou Jhesu of Nazareth? hast thou come to distrie vs? Y woot that thou art the hooli of God.
And Jhesus thretenede hym, and seide, Wex doumbe, and go out of the man.
And the vnclene spirit debreidynge hym, and criynge with greet vois, wente out fro hym.
And alle men wondriden, so that thei souyten with ynne hem silf, and seiden, What thing is this? what newe doctrine is this? for in power he comaundith to vnclene spiritis, and thei obeyen to hym.
And the fame of hym wente forth anoon in to al the cuntree of Galilee.
And anoon thei yeden out of the synagoge, and camen into the hous of Symount and of Andrewe, with James and Joon.
And the modir of Symountis wijf lay sijk in fyueris; and anoon thei seien to hym of hyr.
And he cam nyy, and areride hir, and whanne he hadde take hir hoond, anoon the feuer lefte hir, and sche seruede hem.
But whanne the euentid was come, and the sonne was gon doun, thei brouyten to hym alle that weren of male ese, and hem that hadden fendis.
And al the citee was gaderid at the yate.
And he heelide many, that hadden dyuerse sijknessis, and he castide out many feendis, and he suffride hem not to speke, for thei knewen hym.
And he roos ful eerli, and yede out, and wente in to a desert place, and preiede there.
And Symount suede hym, and thei that weren with hym.
And whanne thei hadden founde hym, thei seiden to hym, That alle men seken thee.
And he seide to hem, Go we in to the next townes and citees, that Y preche also there, for her to Y cam.
And he prechide in the synagogis of hem, and in al Galilee, and castide out feendis.
And a leprouse man cam to hym, and bisouyte, `and knelide, and seide, If thou wolt, thou maist clense me.
And Jhesus hadde mercy on hym, and streiyte out his hoond, and towchyde hym, and seide to hym, I wole, be thou maad cleene.
And whanne he hadde seide this, anoon the lepre partyde awey fro hym, and he was clensyd.
And Jhesus thretenede hym, and anoon Jhesus putte hym out,
and seyde to hym, Se thou, seye to no man; but go, schewe thee to the pryncys of prestys, and offre for thi clensynge in to wytnessyng to hem, tho thingis that Moyses bad.
And he yede out, and bigan to preche, and publische the word, so that now he myyte not go opynli in to the citee, but be withoutforth in desert placis; and thei camen to hym on alle sidis.
And eft he entride in to Cafarnaum, aftir eiyte daies.
And it was herd, that he was in an hous, and many camen to gidir, so that thei miyten not be in the hous, ne at the yate. And he spak to hem the word.
And there camen to hym men that brouyten a man sijk in palesie, which was borun of foure.
And whanne thei myyten not brynge hym to Jhesu for the puple, thei vnhileden the roof where he was, and openede it, and thei leten doun the bed in which the sijk man in palesie laye.
And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the feith of hem, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Sone, thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
But there weren summe of the scribis sittynge, and thenkynge in her hertis,
What spekith he thus? He blasfemeth; who may foryyue synnes, but God aloone?
And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe this bi the Hooli Goost, that thei thouyten so with ynne hem silf, he seith to hem, What thenken ye these thingis in youre hertis?
What is liyter to seie to the sijk man in palesie, Synnes ben foryouun to thee, or to seie, Ryse, take thi bed, and walke?
But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Y seie to thee,
ryse vp, take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
And anoon he roos vp, and whanne he hadde take the bed, he wente bifor alle men, so that alle men wondriden, and onoureden God, and seiden, For we seien neuer so.
And he wente out eftsoone to the see, and al the puple cam to hym; and he tauyte hem.
And whanne he passide, he saiy Leuy `of Alfei sittynge at the tolbothe, and he seide to hym, Sue me. And he roos, and suede hym.
And it was doon, whanne he sat at the mete in his hous, many pupplicans and synful men saten togidere at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis; for there weren many that folewiden hym.
And scribis and Farisees seynge, that he eet with pupplicans and synful men, seiden to hise disciplis, Whi etith and drynkith youre maystir with pupplicans and synneris?
Whanne this was herd, Jhesus seide to hem, Hoole men han no nede to a leche, but thei that ben yuel at eese; for Y cam not to clepe iust men, but synneris.
And the disciplis of Joon and the Farisees weren fastynge; and thei camen, and seien to hym, Whi fasten the disciplis of Joon, and the Farisees fasten, but thi disciplis fasten not?
And Jhesus seide to hem, Whether the sones of sposailis moun faste, as longe as the spouse is with hem? As long tyme as thei haue the spouse with hem, thei moun not faste.
But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun awei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies.
No man sewith a patche of newe clooth to an elde clooth, ellis he takith awei the newe patche fro the elde, and a more brekyng is maad.
And no man puttith newe wyn in to elde botelis, ellis the wyn schal breste the botels, and the wyn schal be sched out, and the botels schulen perische. But newe wyn schal be put into newe botels.
And it was doon eftsoones, whanne the Lord walkid in the sabotis bi the cornes, and hise disciplis bigunnen to passe forth, and plucke eeris of the corn.
And the Farisees seiden to hym, Lo! what thi disciplis doon in sabotis, that is not leeueful.
And he seide to hem, Radden ye neuer what Dauid dide, whanne he hadde nede, and he hungride, and thei that weren with hym?
Hou he wente in to the hous of God, vndur Abiathar, prince of prestis, and eete looues of proposicioun, which it was not leeueful to ete, but to preestis aloone, and he yaf to hem that weren with hym.
And he seide to hem, The sabat is maad for man, and not a man for the sabat;
and so mannus sone is lord also of the sabat.
And he entride eftsoone in to the synagoge, and there was a man hauynge a drye hoond.
And thei aspieden hym, if he helide in the sabatis, to accuse him.
And he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond, Rise in to the myddil.
And he seith to hem, Is it leeueful to do wel in the sabatis, ether yuel? to make a soul saaf, ether to leese? And thei weren stille.
And he biheeld hem aboute with wraththe, and hadde sorewe on the blyndnesse of her herte, and seith to the man, Hold forth thin hoond. And he helde forth, and his hoond was restorid to hym.
Sotheli Farisees yeden out anoon, and maden a counsel with Erodians ayens hym, hou thei schulden lese hym.
But Jhesus with hise disciplis wente to the see; and myche puple fro Galilee and Judee suede hym,
and fro Jerusalem, and fro Ydume, and fro biyondis Jordan, and thei that weren aboute Tire and Sidon, a greet multitude, heringe the thingis that he dide, and cam to hym.
And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis, that the boot schulde serue hym, for the puple, lest thei thristen hym;
for he heelide many, so that thei felden fast to hym, to touche hym. And hou many euer hadde syknessis, and vnclene spirits,
whanne thei seyen hym, felden doun to hym, and crieden, seiynge, Thou art the sone of God.
And greetli he manasside hem, that thei schulden not make hym knowun.
And he wente in to an hille, and clepide to hym whom he wolde; and thei camen to hym.
And he made, that there weren twelue with hym, to sende hem to preche.
And he yaf to hem pouwer to heele sijknessis, and to caste out feendis.
And to Symount he yaf a name Petre, and he clepide James of Zebede and Joon,
the brother of James, and he yaf to hem names Boenarges, that is, sones of thundryng.
And he clepide Andrew and Filip, and Bartholomew and Matheu, and Thomas and James Alfey, and Thadee,
and Symount Cananee, and Judas Scarioth, that bitraiede hym.
And thei camen to an hous, and the puple cam togidere eftsoone, so that thei miyten not ete breed.
And whanne his kynnysmen hadden herd, thei wenten out `to holde him; for thei seiden, that he is turned in to woodnesse.
And the scribis that camen doun fro Jerusalem, seiden, That he hath Belsabub, and that in the prince of deuelis he castith out fendis.
And he clepide hem togidir, and he seide to hem in parablis, Hou may Sathanas caste out Sathanas?
And if a rewme be departid ayens it silf, thilke rewme may not stonde.
And if an hous be disparpoilid on it silf, thilke hous may not stonde.
And if Sathanas hath risun ayens hym silf, he is departid, and he schal not mowe stonde, but hath an ende.
No man may go in to a stronge mannus hous, and take awey hise vessels, but he bynde first the stronge man, and thanne he schal spoile his hous.
Treuli Y seie to you, that alle synnes and blasfemyes, bi whiche thei han blasfemed, schulen be foryouun to the sones of men.
But he that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost, hath not remissioun in to with outen ende, but he schal be gilty of euerlastynge trespas.
For thei seiden, He hath an vnclene spirit.
And his modir and britheren camen, and thei stoden withoutforth, and senten to hym, and clepiden hym.
And the puple sat aboute hym; and thei seien to hym, Lo! thi modir and thi britheren with outforth seken thee.
And he answeride to hem, and seide, Who is my modir and my britheren?
And he bihelde thilke that saten aboute hym, and seide, Lo! my modir and my britheren.
For who that doith the wille of God, he is my brothir, and my sistir, and modir.
And eft Jhesus bigan to teche at the see; and myche puple was gaderid to hym, so that he wente in to a boot, and sat in the see, and al the puple was aboute the see on the loond.
And he tauyte hem in parablis many thingis. And he seide to hem in his techyng,
Here ye. Lo! a man sowynge goith out to sowe.
And the while he sowith, summe seed felde aboute the weie, and briddis of heuene camen, and eeten it.
Othere felde doun on stony places, where it had not myche erthe; and anoon it spronge vp, for it had not depnesse of erthe.
And whanne the sunne roos vp, it welewide for heete, and it driede vp, for it hadde no roote.
And othere felde doun in to thornes, and thornes sprongen vp, and strangliden it, and it yaf not fruyt.
And other felde doun in to good loond, and yaf fruyt, springynge vp, and wexynge; and oon brouyte thretti foold, and oon sixti fold, and oon an hundrid fold.
And he seide, He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
And whanne he was bi hym silf, tho twelue that weren with hym axiden hym to expowne the parable.
And he seide to hem, To you it is youun to knowe the priuete of the kyngdom of God. But to hem that ben with outforth, alle thingis be maad in parablis, that thei seynge se,
and se not, and thei herynge here and vnderstonde not; lest sum tyme thei be conuertid, and synnes be foryouun to hem.
And he seide to hem, Knowe not ye this parable? and hou ye schulen knowe alle parablis?
He that sowith, sowith a word.
But these it ben that ben aboute the weie, where the word is sowun; and whanne thei han herd, anoon cometh Satanas, and takith awei the word that is sowun in her hertis.
And in lijk maner ben these that ben sowun on stony placis, whiche whanne thei han herd the word, anoon thei taken it with ioye;
and thei han not roote in hem silf, but thei ben lastynge a litil tyme; aftirward whanne tribulacioun risith, and persecucioun for the word, anoon thei ben sclaundrid.
And ther ben othir that ben sowun in thornes; these it ben that heren the word,
and disese of the world, and disseit of ritchessis, and othir charge of coueytise entrith, and stranglith the word, and it is maad with out fruyt.
And these it ben that ben sowun on good lond, whiche heren the word, and taken, and maken fruyt, oon thritti fold, oon sixti fold, and oon an hundrid fold.
And he seide to hem, Wher a lanterne cometh, that it be put vndur a buschel, or vndur a bed? nay, but that it be put on a candilstike?
Ther is no thing hid, that schal not be maad opyn; nethir ony thing is pryuey, that schal not come in to opyn.
If ony man haue eeris of heryng, here he.
And he seide to hem, Se ye what ye heren. In what mesure ye meten, it schal be metun to you ayen, and be cast to you.
For it schal be youun to hym that hath, and it schal be takun awei fro him that hath not, also that that he hath.
And he seide, So the kingdom of God is, as if a man caste seede in to the erthe,
and he sleepe, and it rise up niyt and dai, and brynge forth seede, and wexe faste, while he woot not.
For the erthe makith fruyt, first the gras, aftirward the ere, and aftir ful fruyt in the ere.
And whanne of it silf it hath brouyt forth fruyt, anoon he sendith a sikil, for repyng tyme is come.
And he seide, To what thing schulen we likne the kyngdom of God? or to what parable schulen we comparisoun it?
As a corne of seneuei, which whanne it is sowun in the erthe, is lesse than alle seedis that ben in the erthe;
and whanne it is sprongun up, it waxith in to a tre, and is maad gretter than alle erbis; and it makith grete braunchis, so that briddis of heuene moun dwelle vndur the schadewe therof.
And in many suche parablis he spak to hem the word, as thei myyten here;
and he spak not to hem with out parable. But he expownede to hise disciplis alle thingis bi hemsilf.
And he seide to hem in that dai, whanne euenyng was come, Passe we ayenward.
And thei leften the puple, and token hym, so that he was in a boot; and othere bootys weren with hym.
And a greet storm of wynde was maad, and keste wawis in to the boot, so that the boot was ful.
And he was in the hyndir part of the boot, and slepte on a pilewe. And thei reisen hym, and seien to hym, Maistir, perteyneth it not to thee, that we perischen?
And he roos vp, and manasside the wynde, and seide to the see, Be stille, wexe doumbe. And the wynde ceesside, and greet pesiblenesse was maad.
And he seide to hem, What dreden ye? `Ye han no feith yit?
And thei dredden with greet drede, and seiden `ech to other, Who, gessist thou, is this? for the wynde and the see obeschen to hym.
And thei camen ouer the see in to the cuntree of Gerasenes.
And aftir that he was goon out of the boot, anoon a man in an vncleene spirit ran out of birielis to hym.
Which man hadde an hous in biriels, and nether with cheynes now myyte ony man bynde hym.
For ofte tymes he was boundun in stockis and chaynes, and he hadde broke the chaynes, and hadde broke the stockis to smale gobetis, and no man myyte make hym tame.
And euermore, nyyt and dai, in birielis and in hillis, he was criynge and betynge hym silf with stoonus.
And he siy Jhesus afer, and ran, and worschipide hym.
And he criede with greet voice, and seide, What to me and to thee, thou Jhesu, the sone of the hiyest God? Y coniure thee bi God, that thou turmente me not.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Thou vnclene spirit, go out fro the man.
And Jhesus axide hym, What is thi name? And he seith to hym, A legioun is my name; for we ben many.
And he preiede Jhesu myche, that he schulde not putte hym out of the cuntrei.
And there was there aboute the hille a greet flok of swyn lesewynge.
And the spiritis preieden Jhesu, and seiden, Sende vs into the swyn, that we entre in to hem.
And anoon Jhesus grauntide to hem. And the vnclene spiritis yeden out, and entriden in to the swyn, and with a greet birre the flocke was cast doun in to the see, a twei thousynde, and thei weren dreynt in the see.
And thei that kepten hem, fledden, and tolden in to the citee, and in to the feeldis; and thei wenten out, to se what was don.
And thei camen to Jhesu, and sayn hym that hadde be trauelid of the feend, syttynge clothid, and of hool mynde; and thei dredden.
And thei that saien, hou it was don to hym that hadde a feend, and of the swyne, telden to hem.
And thei bigunnen to preie hym, that he schulde go a wei fro her coostis.
And whanne he yede up in to a boot, he that was trauelid of the deuel, bigan to preie hym, that he schulde be with hym.
But Jhesus resseyuede hym not, but seide to hym, Go thou in to thin hous to thine, and telle to hem, hou grete thingis the Lord hath don to thee, and hadde merci of thee.
And he wente forth, and bigan to preche in Decapoli, hou grete thingis Jhesus hadde don to hym; and alle men wondriden.
And whanne Jhesus hadde gon vp in to the boot eftsoone ouer the see, myche puple cam togidere to him, and was aboute the see.
And oon of the princis of synagogis, bi name Jayrus, cam, and siy hym, and felde doun at hise feet,
and preyede hym myche, and seide, My douyter is nyy deed; come thou, putte thin hoond on her, that sche be saaf, and lyue.
And he wente forth with hym, and myche puple suede hym, and thruste hym.
And a womman hadde ben in the blodi fluxe twelue yeer,
and hadde resseyued many thingis of ful many lechis, and hadde spendid al hir good, and was nothing amendid, but was rather the wors, whanne sche hadde herd of Jhesu,
sche cam among the puple bihynde, and touchide his cloth.
For sche seide, That if Y touche yhe his cloth, Y schal be saaf.
And anoon the welle of hir blood was dried vp, and sche felide in bodi that sche was heelid of the siknesse.
And anoon Jhesus knewe in hym silf the vertu that was goon out of hym, and turnede to the puple, and seide, Who touchide my clothis?
And hise disciplis seiden to hym, Thou seest the puple thristynge thee, and seist, Who touchide me?
And Jhesus lokide aboute to se hir that hadde don this thing.
And the womman dredde, and quakide, witynge that it was doon in hir, and cam, and felde doun bifor hym, and seide to hym al the treuthe.
And Jhesus seide to hyr, Douytir, thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go in pees, and he thou hool of thi sijknesse.
Yit while he spak, messangeris camen to the prince of the synagoge, and seien, Thi douytir is deed; what traueilist thou the maistir ferther?
But whanne the word was herd that was seid, Jhesus seide to the prince of the synagoge, Nyle thou drede, oonli bileue thou.
And he took no man to sue hym, but Petir, and James, and Joon, the brother of James.
And thei camen in to the hous of the prince of the synagoge. And he saie noyse, and men wepynge and weilynge myche.
And he yede ynne, and seide to hem, What ben ye troublid, and wepen? The damesel is not deed, but slepith.
And thei scorneden hym. But whanne alle weren put out, he takith the fadir and the modir of the damesel, and hem that weren with hym, and thei entren, where the damysel laye.
And he helde the hoond of the damesel, and seide to hir, Tabita, cumy, that is to seie, Damysel, Y seie to thee, arise.
And anoon the damysel roos, and walkide; and sche was of twelue yeer. And thei weren abaischid with a greet stonying. And he comaundide to hem greetli, that no man schulde wite it.
And he comaundide to yyue hir mete.
And he yede out fro thennus, and wente in to his owne cuntre; and hise disciplis folewiden him.
And whanne the sabat was come, Jhesus bigan to teche in a synagoge. And many herden, and wondriden in his techyng, and seiden, Of whennus to this alle these thingis? and what is the wisdom that is youun to hym, and siche vertues whiche ben maad bi hise hondis?
Whether this is not a carpenter, the sone of Marie, the brother of James and of Joseph and of Judas and of Symount? whether hise sistris ben not here with vs? And thei weren sclaundrid in hym.
And Jhesus seide to hem, That a profete is not without onoure, but in his owne cuntrey, and among his kynne, and in his hous.
And he myyte not do there ony vertu, saue that he helide a fewe sijk men, leiynge on hem hise hoondis.
And he wondride for the vnbileue of hem. And he wente aboute casteles on ech side, and tauyte.
And he clepide togidere twelue, and bigan to sende hem bi two togidere; and yaf to hem power of vnclene spiritis,
and comaundide hem, that thei schulde not take ony thing in the weie, but a yerde oneli, not a scrippe, ne breed, nether money in the girdil,
but schod with sandalies, and that thei schulden not be clothid with twei cootis.
And he seide to hem, Whidur euer ye entren in to an hous, dwelle ye there, til ye goon out fro thennus.
And who euer resseyueth you not, ne herith you, go ye out fro thennus, and schake awei the powdir fro youre feet, in to witnessyng to hem.
And thei yeden forth, and prechiden, that men schulden do penaunce.
And thei castiden out many feendis, and anoyntiden with oyle many sijk men, and thei weren heelid.
And kyng Eroude herde, for his name was maad opyn, and seide, That Joon Baptist hath risen ayen fro deeth, and therfor vertues worchen in hym.
Othir seiden, That it is Helie; but othir seiden, That it is a profete, as oon of profetis.
And whanne this thing was herd, Eroude seide, This Joon, whom Y haue biheedide, is risun ayen fro deeth.
For thilke Eroude sente, and helde Joon, and boond hym in to prisoun, for Erodias, the wijf of Filip, his brothir; for he hadde weddid hir.
For Joon seide to Eroude, It is not leueful to thee, to haue the wijf of thi brothir.
And Erodias leide aspies to hym, and wolde sle hym, and myyte not.
And Eroude dredde Joon, and knewe hym a iust man and hooli, and kepte hym. And Eroude herde hym, and he dide many thingis, and gladli herde hym.
And whanne a couenable dai was fallun, Eroude in his birthdai made a soper to the princis, and tribunes, and to the grettest of Galilee.
And whanne the douyter of thilke Erodias was comun ynne, and daunside, and pleside to Eroude, and also to men that saten at the mete, the kyng seide to the damysel, Axe thou of me what thou wolt, and Y schal yyue to thee.
And he swore to hir, That what euer thou axe, Y schal yyue to thee, thouy it be half my kyngdom.
And whanne sche hadde goon out, sche seide to hir modir, What schal Y axe? And sche seide, The heed of Joon Baptist.
And whanne sche was comun ynne anoon with haast to the kyng, sche axide, and seide, Y wole that anoon thou yyue to me in a dische the heed of Joon Baptist.
And the kyng was sori for the ooth, and for men that saten togidere at the meete he wolde not make hir sori;
but sente a manqueller and comaundide, that Joones heed were brouyt in a dissche. And he bihedide hym in the prisoun,
and brouyte his heed in a disch, and yaf it to the damysel, and the damysel yaf to hir modir.
And whanne this thing was herd, hise disciplis camen, and token his bodi, and leiden it in a biriel.
And the apostlis camen togidere to Jhesu, and telden to hym alle thingis, that thei hadden don, and tauyt.
And he seide to hem, Come ye bi you silf in to a desert place; and reste ye a litil. For there were many that camen, and wenten ayen, and thei hadden not space to ete.
And thei yeden in to a boot, and wenten in to a desert place bi hem silf.
And thei sayn hem go awei, and many knewen, and thei wenten afoote fro alle citees, and runnen thidur, and camen bifor hem.
And Jhesus yede out, and saiy myche puple, and hadde reuth on hem, for thei weren as scheep not hauynge a scheepherd. And he bigan to teche hem many thingis.
And whanne it was forth daies, hise disciplis camen, and seiden, This is a desert place, and the tyme is now passid;
lete hem go in to the nexte townes and villagis, to bie hem meete to ete.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Yyue ye to hem to ete. And thei seiden to hym, Go we, and bie we looues with two hundrid pens, and we schulen yyue to hem to ete.
And he seith to hem, Hou many looues han ye? Go ye, and se. And whanne thei hadden knowe, thei seien, Fyue, and two fischis.
And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden make alle men sitte to mete bi cumpanyes, on greene heye.
And thei saten doun bi parties, bi hundridis, and bi fifties.
And whanne he hadde take the fyue looues, and twei fischis, he biheelde in to heuene, and blesside, and brak looues, and yaf to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette bifor hem. And he departide twei fischis to alle;
and alle eeten, and weren fulfillid.
And thei token the relifs of brokun metis, twelue cofyns ful, and of the fischis.
And thei that eeten, weren fyue thousynde of men.
And anoon he maad hise disciplis to go up in to a boot, to passe bifor hym ouer the se to Bethsaida, the while he lefte the puple.
And whanne he hadde left hem, he wente in to an hille, to preye.
And whanne it was euen, the boot was in the myddil of the see, and he aloone in the loond;
and he say hem trauelynge in rowyng; for the wynde was contrarie to hem. And aboute the fourthe wakynge of the nyyt, he wandride on the see, and cam to hem, and wolde passe hem.
And as thei sayn hym wandrynge on the see, thei gessiden that it weren a fantum, and crieden out;
for alle sayn hym, and thei weren afraied. And anoon he spak with hem, and seide to hem, Triste ye, Y am; nyle ye drede.
And he cam vp to hem in to the boot, and the wynde ceesside. And thei wondriden more `with ynne hem silf;
for thei vndurstoden not of the looues; for her herte was blyndid.
And whanne thei weren passid ouer the see, thei camen in to the lond of Genasareth, and settiden to loond.
And whanne thei weren gon out of the boot, anoon thei knewen hym.
And thei ranne thorou al that cuntre, and bigunnen to brynge sijk men in beddis on eche side, where thei herden that he was.
And whidur euer `he entride in to villagis, ethir in to townes, or in to citees, thei setten sijk men in stretis, and preiden hym, that thei schulden touche namely the hemme of his cloth; and hou many that touchiden hym, weren maad saaf.
And the Farisees and summe of the scribis camen fro Jerusalem togidir to hym.
And whanne thei hadden seen summe of hise disciplis ete breed with vnwaisschen hoondis, thei blameden.
The Farisees and alle the Jewis eten not, but thei waisschen ofte her hoondis, holdynge the tradiciouns of eldere men.
And whanne thei turnen ayen fro chepyng, thei eten not, but thei ben waisschen; and many other thingis ben, `that ben taken `to hem to kepe, wasschyngis of cuppis, and of watir vessels, and of vessels of bras, and of beddis.
And Farisees and scribis axiden hym, and seiden, Whi gon not thi disciplis aftir the tradicioun of eldere men, but with vnwasschen hondis thei eten breed?
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Ysaie prophesiede wel of you, ypocritis, as it is writun, This puple worschipith me with lippis, but her herte is fer fro me;
and in veyn thei worschipen me, techinge the doctrines and the heestis of men.
For ye leeuen the maundement of God, and holden the tradiciouns of men, wasschyngis of watir vessels, and of cuppis; and many othir thingis lijk to these ye doon.
And he seide to hem, Wel ye han maad the maundement of God voide, `to kepe youre tradicioun.
For Moyses seide, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir; and he that cursith fadir or modir, die he by deeth.
But ye seien, If a man seie to fadir or modir, Corban, that is, What euer yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee;
and ouer ye suffren not hym do ony thing to fadir or modir,
and ye breken the word of God bi youre tradicioun, that ye han youun; and ye don many suche thingis.
And he eftsoone clepide the puple, and seide to hem, Ye alle here me, and vndurstonde.
No thing that is withouten a man, that entrith in to hym, may defoule him; but tho thingis that comen forth of a man, tho it ben that defoulen a man.
If ony man haue eeris of hering, here he.
And whanne he was entrid in to an hous, fro the puple, hise disciplis axiden hym the parable.
And he seide to hem, Ye ben vnwise also. Vndurstonde ye not, that al thing without forth that entreth in to a man, may not defoule hym?
for it hath not entrid in to his herte, but in to the wombe, and bynethe it goith out, purgynge alle metis.
But he seide, The thingis that gon out of a man, tho defoulen a man.
For fro with ynne, of the herte of men comen forth yuel thouytis, auowtries,
fornycaciouns, mansleyingis, theftis, auaricis, wickidnessis, gile, vnchastite, yuel iye, blasfemyes, pride, foli.
Alle these yuels comen forth fro with ynne, and defoulen a man.
And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tyre and of Sidon. And he yede in to an hous, and wolde that no man wiste; and he myyte not be hid.
For a womman, anoon as sche herd of hym, whos douytir hadde an vnclene spirit, entride, and fel doun at hise feet.
And the womman was hethen, of the generacioun of Sirofenyce. And sche preiede hym, that he wolde caste out a deuel fro hir douyter.
And he seide to hir, Suffre thou, that the children be fulfillid first; for it is not good to take the breed of children, and yyue to houndis.
And sche answeride, and seide to him, Yis, Lord; for litil whelpis eten vndur the bord, of the crummes of children.
And Jhesus seide to hir, Go thou, for this word the feend wente out of thi douytir.
And whanne sche was gon in to hir hous home, sche foonde the damysel ligynge on the bed, and the deuel gon out fro hir.
And eftsoones Jhesus yede out fro the coostis of Tire, and cam thorou Sidon to the see of Galilee, bitwixe the myddil of the coostis of Decapoleos.
And thei bryngen to hym a man deef and doumbe, and preieden hym to leye his hoond on hym.
And he took hym asidis fro the puple, and puttide hise fyngris in to hise eris; and he spetide, and touchide his tonge.
And he bihelde in to heuene, and sorewide with ynne, and seide, Effeta, that is, Be thou openyd.
And anoon hise eris weren openyd, and the boond of his tunge was vnboundun, and he spak riytli.
And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden seie to no man; but hou myche he comaundide to hem, so myche more thei prechiden,
and bi so myche more thei wondriden, and seiden, He dide wel alle thingis, and he made deef men to here, and doumbe men to speke.
In tho daies eft, whanne myche puple was with Jhesu, and hadden not what thei schulden ete, whanne hise disciplis weren clepid togidir,
he seide to hem, I haue reuth on the puple, for lo! now the thridde dai thei abiden me, and han not what to ete;
and if Y leeue hem fastynge in to her hous, thei schulen faile in the weie; for summe of hem camen fro fer.
And hise disciplis answerden to hym, Wherof schal a man mowe fille hem with looues here in wildirnesse?
And he axide hem, Hou many looues han ye?
Whiche seiden, Seuene. And he comaundide the puple to sitte doun on the erthe. And he took the seuene looues, and dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette forth. And thei settiden forth to the puple.
And thei hadden a few smale fischis; and he blesside hem, and comaundide, that thei weren sette forth.
And thei eten, and weren fulfillid; and thei token vp that that lefte of relifs, seuene lepis.
And thei that eeten, weren as foure thousynde of men; and he lefte hem.
And anoon he wente vp in to a boot, with hise disciplis, and cam in to the coostis of Dalmamytha.
And the Farisees wenten out, and bigunnen to dispuyte with hym, and axiden a tokne of hym fro heuene, and temptiden hym.
And he sorewynge `with ynne in spirit, seide, What sekith this generacioun a tokne? Treuli Y seie to you, a tokene schal not be youun to this generacioun.
And he lefte hem, and wente vp eftsoone in to a boot, and wente ouer the see.
And thei foryaten to take breed, and thei hadden not with hem but o loof in the boot.
And he comaundide hem, and seide, Se ye, and `be war of the sowre dowy of Farisees, and of the sowrdowy of Eroude.
And thei thouyten, and seiden oon to anothir, For we han not looues.
And whanne this thing was knowun, Jhesus seide to hem, What thenken ye, for ye han not looues? Yit ye knowun not, ne vndurstonden; yit ye han youre herte blyndid.
Ye hauynge iyen, seen not, and ye hauynge eeris, heren not; nethir ye han mynde,
whanne Y brak fyue looues among fyue thousynde, and hou many cofynes ful of brokun meete `ye tokun vp? Thei seien to hym, Twelue.
Whanne also seuene looues among foure thousynde of men, hou many lepis of brokun mete tokun ye vp?
And thei seien to hym, Seuene. And he seide to hem, Hou vndurstonden ye not yit?
And thei camen to Bethsaida, and thei bryngen to hym a blynde man, and thei preieden hym, that he schulde touche hym.
And whanne he hadde take the blynde mannus hoond, he ledde hym out of the street, and spete in to hise iyen, and sette hise hoondis on hym; and he axide hym, if he saye ony thing.
And he bihelde, and seide, Y se men as trees walkynge.
Aftirward eftsoones he sette hise hondis on hise iyen, and he bigan to see, and he was restorid, so that he saiy cleerli alle thingis.
And he sente hym in to his hous, and seide, Go in to thin hous; and if thou goist in to the streete, seie to no man.
And Jhesus entride and hise disciplis in to the castels of Cesarye of Philip. And in the weie he axide hise disciplis, and seide to hem, Whom seien men that Y am?
Whiche answeriden to hym, and seiden, Summen seien, Joon Baptist; other seien, Heli; and other seien, as oon of the prophetis.
Thanne he seith to hem, But whom seien ye that Y am? Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Thou art Crist.
And he chargide hem, that thei schulden not seie of hym to ony man.
And he bigan to teche hem, that it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of the elder men, and of the hiyest prestis, and the scribis, and to be slayn, and aftir thre dayes, to rise ayen.
And he spak pleynli the word. And Peter took hym, and bigan to blame hym, and seide, Lord, be thou merciful to thee, for this schal not be.
And he turnede, and saiy hise disciplis, and manasside Petir, and seide, Go after me, Satanas; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God, but tho thingis that ben of men.
And whanne the puple was clepid togidere, with hise disciplis, he seide to hem, If ony man wole come after me, denye he hym silf, and take his cros, and sue he me.
For he that wole make saaf his lijf, schal leese it; and he that leesith his lijf for me, and for the gospel, schal make it saaf.
For what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and do peiryng to his soule?
or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule?
But who that knoulechith me and my wordis in this generacioun avowtresse and synful, also mannus sone schal knouleche him, whanne he schal come in the glorie of his fadir, with his aungels. And he seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, that there ben summen stondynge here, whiche schulen not taste deth, til thei seen the rewme of God comynge in vertu.
And aftir sixe daies Jhesus took Petre, and James, and Joon, and ledde hem bi hem silf aloone in to an hiy hille; and he was transfigurid bifor hem.
And hise clothis weren maad ful schynynge and white as snow, whiche maner white clothis a fuller may not make on erthe.
And Helie with Moises apperide to hem, and thei spaken with Jhesu.
And Petre answeride, and seide to Jhesu, Maister, it is good vs to be here; and make we here thre tabernaclis, oon to thee, oon to Moyses, and oon to Helie.
For he wiste not what he schulde seie; for thei weren agaste bi drede.
And ther was maad a cloude overschadewynge hem; and a vois cam of the cloude, and seide, This is my moost derworth sone, here ye hym.
And anoon thei bihelden aboute, and sayn no more ony man, but Jhesu oonli with hem.
And whanne thei camen doun fro the hille, he comaundide hem, that thei schulden not telle to ony man tho thingis that thei hadden seen, but whanne mannus sone hath risun ayen fro deeth.
And thei helden the word at hem silf, sekynge what this schulde be, whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth.
And thei axiden hym, and seiden, What thanne seien Farisees and scribis, for it bihoueth `Helie to come first.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Whanne Helie cometh, he schal first restore alle thingis; and as it is writun of mannus sone, that he suffre many thingis, and be dispisid.
And Y seie to you, that Helie is comun, and thei diden to hym what euer thingis thei wolden, as it is writun of hym.
And he comynge to hise disciplis, saiy a greet cumpany aboute hem, and scribis disputynge with hem.
And anoon al the puple seynge Jhesu, was astonyed, and thei dredden; and thei rennynge gretten hym.
And he axide hem, What disputen ye among you?
And oon of the cumpany answerde, and seide, Mayster, Y haue brouyt to thee my sone, that hath a doumbe spirit; and where euer he takith hym,
he hurtlith hym doun, and he fometh, and betith togidir with teeth, and wexith drye. And Y seide to thi disciplis, that thei schulden caste hym out, and thei myyten not.
And he answeride to hem, and seide, A! thou generacioun out of bileue, hou longe schal Y be among you, hou longe schal Y suffre you? Brynge ye hym to me.
And thei brouyten hym. And whanne he had seyn him, anoon the spirit troublide him; and was throw doun to grounde, and walewide, and fomede.
And he axide his fadir, Hou longe `is it, sith this `hath falle to hym? And he seide, Fro childhode;
and ofte he hath put hym in to fier, and in to watir, to leese hym; but if thou maiste ony thing, helpe vs, and haue merci on vs.
And Jhesus seide to hym, If thou maiste bileue, alle thingis ben possible to man that bileueth.
And anoon the fadir of the child criede with teeris, and seide, Lord, Y bileue; Lord, helpe thou myn vnbileue.
And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the puple rennynge togidere, he manasside the vnclene spirit, and seide to hym, Thou deef and doumbe spirit, Y comaunde thee, go out fro hym, and entre no more in to hym.
And he criynge, and myche to breidynge him, wente out fro hym; and he was maad as deed, so that many seiden, that he was deed.
And Jhesus helde his hoond, and lifte hym vp; and he roos.
And whanne he hadde entrid in to an hous, hise disciplis axiden hym priueli, Whi myyten not we caste hym out?
And he seide to hem, This kynde in no thing may go out, but in preier and fastyng.
And thei yeden fro thennus, and wente forth in to Galile; and thei wolden not, that ony man wiste.
And he tauyte hise disciplis, and seide to hem, For mannus sone schal be bitrayed in to the hondis of men, and thei schulen sle hym, and he slayn schal ryse ayen on the thridde day.
And thei knewen not the word, and dredden to axe hym.
And thei camen to Cafarnaum. And whanne thei weren in the hous, he axide hem, What tretiden ye in the weie?
And thei weren stille; for thei disputiden among hem in the weie, who of hem schulde be grettest.
And he sat, and clepide the twelue, and seide to hem, If ony man wole be the firste among you, he schal be the laste of alle, and the mynyster of alle.
And he took a child, and sette hym in the myddil of hem; and whanne he hadde biclippid hym, he seide to hem,
Who euer resseyueth oon of such children in my name, he resseyueth me; and who euer resseyueth me, he resseyueth not me aloone, but hym that sente me.
Joon answeride to hym, and seide, Maister, we sayn oon castynge out feendis in thi name, which sueth not vs, and we han forbodun hym.
And Jhesus seide, Nyle ye forbede him; for ther is no man that doith vertu in my name, and may soone speke yuel of me.
He that is not ayens vs, is for vs.
And who euer yyueth you a cuppe of coold water to drynke in my name, for ye ben of Crist, treuli Y seie to you, he schal not leese his mede.
And who euer schal sclaundre oon of these litle that bileuen in me, it were betere to hym that a mylne stoon `of assis were don aboute his necke, and he were cast in to the see.
And if thin hoond sclaundre thee, kitte it awey; it is betere to thee to entre feble in to lijf, than haue two hondis, and go in to helle, in to fier that neuer schal be quenchid,
where the worm of hem dieth not, and the fier is not quenchid.
And if thi foote sclaundre thee, kitte it of; it is betere to thee to entre crokid in to euerlastynge lijf, than haue twei feet, and be sent in to helle of fier, that neuer schal be quenchid,
where the worme of hem dieth not, and the fier is not quenchid.
That if thin iye sclaundre thee, cast it out; it is betere to thee to entre gogil iyed in to the reume of God, than haue twey iyen, and be sent in to helle of fier, where the worme of hem dieth not,
and the fier is not quenchid.
And euery man schal be saltid with fier,
and euery slayn sacrifice schal be maad sauery with salt.
Salt is good; if salt be vnsauery, in what thing schulen ye make it sauery? Haue ye salt among you, and haue ye pees among you.
And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus, and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan; and eftsoones the puple cam togidere to hym, and as he was wont, eftsoone he tauyte hem.
And the Farisees camen, and axiden hym, Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf? and thei temptiden hym.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, What comaundide Moises to you?
And thei seiden, Moises suffride to write a libel of forsaking, and to forsake.
`To whiche Jhesus answeride, and seide, For the hardnesse of youre herte Moises wroot to you this comaundement.
But fro the bigynnyng of creature God made hem male and female;
and seide, For this thing a man schal leeue his fadir and modir,
and schal drawe to hys wijf, and thei schulen be tweyne in o flesch. And so now thei ben not tweyne, but o flesch.
Therfor that thing that God ioynede togidere, no man departe.
And eftsoone in the hous hise disciplis axiden hym of the same thing.
And he seide to hem, Who euer leeuith his wijf, and weddith another, he doith auowtri on hir.
And if the wijf leeue hir housebonde, and be weddid to another man, sche doith letcherie.
And thei brouyten to hym litle children, that he schulde touche hem; and the disciplis threteneden the men, that brouyten hem.
And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hem, he baar heuy, and seide to hem, Suffre ye litle children to come to me, and forbede ye hem not, for of suche is the kyngdom of God.
Treuli Y seie to you, who euer resseyueth not the kyngdom of God as a litil child, he schal not entre in to it.
And he biclippide hem, and leide hise hondis on hem, and blisside hem.
And whanne Jhesus was gon out in the weie, a man ranne bifore, and knelide bifor hym, and preiede hym, and seide, Good maister, what schal Y do, that Y resseyue euerlastynge lijf?
And Jhesus seide to hym, What seist thou, that Y am good? Ther is no man good, but God hym silf.
Thou knowist the comaundementis, do thou noon auowtrie, `sle not, stele not, seie not fals witnessyng, do no fraude, worschipe thi fadir and thi modir.
And he answeride, and seide to hym, Maister, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe.
And Jhesus bihelde hym, and louede hym, and seide to hym, O thing faileth to thee; go thou, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene; and come, sue thou me.
And he was ful sori in the word, and wente awei mornyng, for he hadde many possessiouns.
And Jhesus bihelde aboute, and seide to hise disciplis, Hou hard thei that han ritchessis schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God.
And the disciplis weren astonyed in hise wordis. And Jhesus eftsoone answeride, and seide `to hem, Ye litle children, hou hard it is for men that tristen in ritchessis to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
It is liyter a camele to passe thorou a nedlis iye, than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
And thei wondriden more, and seiden among hem silf, And who may be sauyd?
And Jhesus bihelde hem, and seide, Anentis men it is impossible, but not anentis God; for alle thingis ben possible anentis God.
And Petir bigan to seie to hym, Lo! we han left alle thingis, and han sued thee.
Jhesus answeride, and seide, Treuli Y seie to you, ther is no man that leeueth hous, or britheren, or sistris, or fadir, or modir, or children, or feeldis for me and for the gospel,
which schal not take an hundrid fold so myche now in this tyme, housis, and britheren, and sistris, and modris, and children, and feeldis, with persecuciouns, and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf.
But many schulen be, the firste the last, and the last the firste.
And thei weren in the weie goynge vp to Jerusalem; and Jhesus wente bifor hem, and thei wondriden, and foleweden, and dredden. And eftsoone Jhesus took the twelue, and bigan to seie to hem, what thingis weren to come to hym.
For lo! we stien to Jerusalem, and mannus sone schal be bitraied to the princis of prestis, and to scribis, and to the eldre men; and thei schulen dampne hym bi deth, and thei schulen take hym to hethene men. And thei schulen scorne hym,
and bispete hym, and bete him; and thei schulen sle hym, and in the thridde dai he schal rise ayen.
And James and Joon, Zebedees sones, camen to hym, and seiden, Maister, we wolen, that what euer we axen, thou do to vs.
And he seide to hem, What wolen ye that Y do to you?
And thei seiden, Graunte to vs, that we sitten `the toon at thi riythalf, and the tother at thi left half, in thi glorie.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Ye witen not what ye axen; moun ye drynke the cuppe, which Y schal drynke, or be waischun with the baptym, in which Y am baptisid?
And thei seiden to hym, We moun. And Jhesus seide to hem, Ye schulen drynke the cuppe that Y drynke, and ye schulen be waschun with the baptym, in which Y am baptisid;
but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf is not myn to yyue to you, but to whiche it is maad redi.
And the ten herden, and bigunnen to haue indignacioun of James and Joon.
But Jhesus clepide hem, and seide to hem, Ye witen, that thei that semen to haue prynshode of folkis, ben lordis of hem, and the princes of hem han power of hem.
But it is not so among you, but who euer wole be maad gretter, schal be youre mynyster;
and who euer wole be the firste among you, schal be seruaunt of alle.
For whi mannus sone cam not, that it schulde be mynystrid to hym, but that he schulde mynystre, and yyue his lijf ayenbiyng for manye.
And thei camen to Jerico; and whanne he yede forth fro Jerico, and hise disciplis, and a ful myche puple, Barthymeus, a blynde man, the sone of Thimei, sat bisidis the weie, and beggide.
And whanne he herde, that it is Jhesus of Nazareth, he bigan to crie, and seie, Jhesu, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me.
And manye thretneden hym, that he schulde be stille; and he criede myche the more, Jhesu, the sone of Dauid, haue merci on me.
And Jhesus stood, and comaundide hym to be clepid; and thei clepen the blynde man, and seien to hym, Be thou of betere herte, rise vp, he clepith thee.
And he castide awei his cloth, and skippide, and cam to hym.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, What wolt thou, that Y schal do to thee? The blynde man seide to hym, Maister, that Y se.
Jhesus seide to hym, Go thou, thi feith hath maad thee saaf. And anoon he saye, and suede hym in the weie.
And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem and to Betanye, to the mount of Olyues, he sendith tweyne of hise disciplis, and seith to hem,
Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you; and anoon as ye entren there ye schulen fynde a colt tied, on which no man hath sete yit; vntie ye, and brynge hym.
And if ony man seye ony thing to you, What doen ye? seie ye, that he is nedeful to the Lord, and anoon he schal leeue hym hidir.
And thei yeden forth, and founden a colt tied bifor the yate with out forth, in the metyng of twei weies; and thei vntieden hym.
And summe of hem that stoden there seiden to hem, What doen ye, vntiynge the colt?
And thei seiden to hem, as Jhesus comaundide hem; and thei leften it to hem.
And thei brouyten the colt to Jhesu, and thei leiden on hym her clothis, and Jhesus sat on hym.
And many strewiden her clothis in the weie, othere men kittiden braunchis fro trees, and strewiden in the weie.
And thei that wenten bifor, and that sueden, crieden, and seiden, Osanna,
blissid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; blessid be the kyngdom of oure fadir Dauid that is come; Osanna in hiyest thingis.
And he entride in to Jerusalem, in to the temple; and whanne he `hadde seyn al thing aboute, whanne it was eue, he wente out in to Betanye, with the twelue.
And anothir daye, whanne he wente out of Betanye, he hungride.
And whanne he hadde seyn a fige tree afer hauynge leeues, he cam, if happili he schulde fynde ony thing theron; and whanne he cam to it, he foonde no thing, out takun leeues; for it was not tyme of figis.
And Jhesus answeride and seide to it, Now neuer ete ony man fruyt of thee more. And hise disciplis herden;
and thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he was entrid in to the temple, he bigan to caste out silleris and biggeris in the temple; and he turnede vpsodoun the bordis of chaungeris, and the chayeris of men that selden culueris;
and he suffride not, that ony man schulde bere a vessel thorou the temple.
And he tauyte hem, and seide, Whether it is not writun, That myn hous schal be clepid the hous of preyng to alle folkis? but ye han maad it a denne of theues.
And whanne this thing was herd, the princis of prestis and scribis souyten hou thei schulden leese hym; for thei dredden hym, for al the puple wondride on his techyng.
And whanne euenyng was come, he wente out of the citee.
And as thei passiden forth eerli, thei sayn the fige tree maad drye fro the rootis.
And Petir bithouyte hym, and seide to hym, Maister, lo! the fige tree, whom thou cursidist, is dried vp.
And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Haue ye the feith of God;
treuli Y seie to you, that who euer seith to this hil, Be thou takun, and cast in to the see; and doute not in his herte, but bileueth, that what euer he seie, schal be don, it schal be don to hym.
Therfor Y seie to you, alle thingis what euer thingis ye preynge schulen axe, bileue ye that ye schulen take, and thei schulen come to you.
And whanne ye schulen stonde to preye, foryyue ye, if ye han ony thing ayens ony man, that youre fadir that is in heuenes, foryyue to you youre synnes.
And if ye foryyuen not, nether youre fadir that is in heuenes, schal foryyue to you youre synnes.
And eftsoone thei camen to Jerusalem. And whanne he walkide in the temple, the hiyeste prestis, and scribis, and the elder men camen to hym,
and seyn to hym, In what power doist thou these thingis? or who yaf to thee this power, that thou do these thingis?
Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word, and answere ye to me, and Y schal seie to you in what power Y do these thingis.
Whether was the baptym of Joon of heuene, or of men? answere ye to me.
And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, seiynge, If we seien of heuene, he schal seie to vs, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to him;
if we seien of men, we dreden the puple; for alle men hadden Joon, that he was verili a prophete.
And thei answeryden, and seien to Jhesu, We witen neuer. And Jhesu answerde, and seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
And Jhesus bigan to speke to hem in parablis. A man plauntide a vynyerd, and sette an hegge aboute it, and dalf a lake, and bildide a toure, and hiryde it to tilieris, and wente forth in pilgrimage.
And he sente to the erthe tilieris in tyme a seruaunt, to resseyue of the erthe tilieris of the fruyt of the vynyerd.
And thei token hym, and beeten, and leften hym voide.
And eftsoone he sente to hem anothir seruaunt, and thei woundiden hym in the heed, and turmentiden hym.
And eftsoone he sente another, and thei slowen hym, and othir mo, betynge summe, and sleynge othere.
But yit he hadde a moost derworth sone, and he sente hym last to hem, and seide, Perauenture thei schulen drede my sone.
But the erthetilieris seiden togidere, This is the eire; come ye, sle we hym, and the eritage schal be ourun.
And thei tokun hym, and killiden, and castiden out without the vynyerd.
Thanne what schal the lord of the vynyerd do? He schal come, and lese the tilieris, and yyue the vynyerd to othere.
Whether ye han not red this scripture, The stoon which the bilderis han disspisid, this is maad in to the heed of the corner?
This thing is doon of the Lord, and is wondirful in oure iyen.
And thei souyten to holde hym, and thei dredden the puple; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this parable; and thei leften hym,
and thei wenten awei. And thei senten to hym summe of the Farisees and Erodians, to take hym in word.
Whiche camen, and seien to hym, Maistir, we witen that thou art sothfast, and reckist not of ony man; for nethir thou biholdist in to the face of man, but thou techist the weie of God in treuthe. Is it leeueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure, or we schulen not yyue?
Which witynge her pryuei falsnesse, seide to hem, What tempten ye me? brynge ye to me a peny, that Y se.
And thei brouyten to hym. And he seide to hem, Whos is this ymage, and the writyng? Thei seien to him, The emperouris.
And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Thanne yelde ye to the emperour tho thingis that ben of the emperours; and to God tho thingis that ben of God.
And thei wondriden of hym. And Saduces, that seien that ther is no ressurreccioun, camen to hym, and axeden hym,
and seiden, Maister, Moyses wroot to vs, that if the brother of a man were deed, and lefte his wijf, and haue no sones, his brother take his wijf, and reise vp seed to his brother.
Thanne seuene britheren ther weren; and the firste took a wijf, and diede, and lefte no seed.
And the secounde took hir, and he diede, and nether this lefte seed.
And the thridde also. And in lijk manere the seuene token hir, and leften not seed. And the womman the laste of alle `is deed.
Thanne in the resurreccioun, whanne thei schulen rise ayen, whos wijf of these schal sche be? for seuene hadden hir to wijf.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Whether ye erren not therfor, that ye knowe not scripturis, nethir the vertu of God?
For whanne thei schulen rise ayen fro deeth, nether thei schulen wedde, nethir schulen be weddid, but thei schulen be as aungels of God in heuenes.
And of deed men, that thei risen ayen, han ye not red in the book of Moises, on the buysch, hou God spak to hym, and seide, Y am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob?
He is not God of deed men, but of lyuynge men; therfor ye erren myche.
And oon of the scribis, that hadde herde hem dispuytynge togidir, cam nyy, and saiy that Jhesus had wel answeride hem, and axide hym, which was the firste maundement of alle.
And Jhesus answeride to him, that the firste maundement of alle is, Here thou, Israel, thi Lord God is o God;
and thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of al thi mynde, and of al thi myyt.
This is the firste maundement. And the secounde is lijk to this, Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf. Ther is noon other maundement gretter than these.
And the scribe seide to hym, Maister, in treuthe thou hast wel seid; for o God is, and ther is noon other, outakun hym;
that he be loued of al the herte, and of al the mynde, and of al the vndurstondynge, and of al the soule, and of al strengthe, and to loue the neiybore as hym silf, is gretter than alle brent offryngis and sacrifices.
And Jhesus seynge that he hadde answerid wiseli, seide to hym, Thou art not fer fro the kyngdom of God.
And thanne no man durste axe hym no more ony thing. And Jhesus answeride and seide, techynge in the temple, Hou seien scribis, that Crist is the sone of Dauid?
For Dauid hym silf seide in the Hooli Goost, the Lord seide to my lord, Sitte on my riythalf, til Y putte thin enemyes the stool of thi feet.
Thanne Dauid hym silf clepith him lord, hou thanne is he his sone? And myche puple gladli herde hym.
And he seide to hem in his techyng, Be ye war of scribis, that wolen wandre in stolis,
and be salutid in chepyng, and sitte in synagogis in the firste chaieris, and the firste sittyng placis in soperis;
whiche deuouren the housis of widewis vndur colour of long preier; thei schulen take the longer doom.
And Jhesus sittynge ayens the tresorie, bihelde hou the puple castide monei in to the tresorie; and many riche men castiden many thingis.
But whanne a pore widewe was comun, sche keste two mynutis, that is, a ferthing.
And he clepide togidere hise disciplis, and seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, that this pore widewe keste more thanne alle, that kesten in to the tresorie.
For alle kesten of that thing that thei hadden plente of; but this of her pouert keste alle thingis that sche hadde, al hir lyuelode.
And whanne he wente out of the temple, oon of hise disciplis seide to hym, Maister, biholde, what maner stoonys, and what maner bildyngis.
And Jhesu answeride, and seide to hym, Seest thou alle these grete bildingis? ther schal not be left a stoon on a stoon, which schal not be distried.
And whanne he sat in the mount of Olyues ayens the temple, Petir and James and Joon and Andrew axiden hym bi hem silf,
Seie thou to vs, whanne these thingis schulen be don, and what tokene schal be, whanne alle these thingis schulen bigynne to be endid.
And Jhesus answeride, and bigan to seie to hem, Loke ye, that no man disseyue you;
for manye schulen come in my name, seiynge, That Y am; and thei schulen disseyue manye.
And whanne ye here batels and opynyouns of batels, drede ye not; for it bihoueth these thingis to be doon, but not yit anoon is the ende.
For folk schal rise on folk, and rewme on rewme, and erthe mouyngis and hungur schulen be bi placis; these thingis schulen be bigynnyngis of sorewis.
But se ye you silf, for thei schulen take you in counsels, and ye schulen be betun in synagogis; and ye schulen stonde bifor kyngis and domesmen for me, in witnessyng to hem.
And it bihoueth, that the gospel be first prechid among al folk.
And whanne thei taken you, and leden you forth, nyle ye bifore thenke what ye schulen speke, but speke ye that thing that schal be youun to you in that our; for ye ben not the spekeris, but the Hooli Goost.
For a brother schal bitake the brother in to deth, and the fadir the sone, and sones schulen rise togider ayens fadris and modris, and punysche hem bi deeth.
And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name; but he that lastith in to the ende, schal be saaf.
But whanne ye schulen se the abhomynacioun of discoumfort, stondynge where it owith not; he that redith, vndurstonde; thanne thei that be in Judee, fle `in to hillis.
And he that is aboue the roof, come not doun in to the hous, nethir entre he, to take ony thing of his hous;
and he that schal be in the feeld, turne not ayen bihynde to take his cloth.
But wo to hem that ben with child, and norischen in tho daies.
Therfor preye ye, that thei be not don in wyntir.
But thilke daies of tribulacioun schulen be suche, whiche maner weren not fro the bigynnyng of creature, which God hath maad, til now, nethir schulen be.
And but the Lord hadde abredgide tho daies, al fleische hadde not be saaf; but for the chosun whiche he chees, the Lord hath maad schort the daies.
And thanne if ony man seie to you, Lo! here is Crist, lo! there, bileue ye not.
For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise, and schulen yyue tokenes and wondris, to disseyue, if it may be don, yhe, hem that be chosun.
Therfor take ye kepe; lo! Y haue bifor seid to you alle thingis.
But in tho daies, aftir that tribulacioun, the sunne schal be maad derk, and the moon schal not yyue hir liyt,
and the sterris of heuene schulen falle doun, and the vertues that ben in heuenes, schulen be moued.
And thanne thei schulen se mannus sone comynge in cloudis of heuene, with greet vertu and glorie.
And thanne he schal sende hise aungelis, and schal geder hise chosun fro the foure wyndis, fro the hiyest thing of erthe til to the hiyest thing of heuene.
But of the fige tree lerne ye the parable. Whanne now his braunche is tendre, and leeues ben sprongun out, ye knowen that somer is nyy.
So whanne ye seen these thingis be don, wite ye, that it is nyy in the doris.
Treuli Y seie to you, that this generacioun schal not passe awei, til alle these thingis be don.
Heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
But of that dai or our no man woot, nether aungels in heuene, nether the sone, but the fadir.
Se ye, wake ye, and preie ye; for ye witen not, whanne the tyme is.
For as a man that is gon fer in pilgrimage, lefte his hous, and yaf to his seruauntis power of euery work, and comaundide to the porter, that he wake.
Therfor wake ye, for ye witen not, whanne the lord of the hous cometh, in the euentide, or at mydnyyt, or at cockis crowyng, or in the mornyng;
leste whanne he cometh sodenli, he fynde you slepynge.
Forsothe that that Y seie to you, Y seie to alle, Wake ye.
Pask and the feest of therf looues was after twei daies. And the hiyest preestis and scribis souyten, hou thei schulden holde hym with gile, and sle.
But thei seiden, Not in the feeste dai, lest perauenture a noyse were maad among the puple.
And whanne he was at Betanye, in the hous of Symount leprous, and restide, a womman cam, that hadde a boxe of alabastre of precious oynement spikenard; and whanne the boxe of alabastre was brokun, sche helde it on his heed.
But there weren summe that beren it heuyli with ynne hem silf, and seiden, Wher to is this losse of oynement maad?
For this oynement myyte haue be seld more than for thre hundrid pens, and be youun to pore men. And thei groyneden ayens hir.
But Jhesus seide, Suffre ye hir; what be ye heuy to hir? sche hath wrouyt a good werk in me.
For euermore ye schulen haue pore men with you, and whanne ye wolen, ye moun do wel to hem; but ye schulen not euer more haue me.
Sche dide that that sche hadde; sche cam bifore to anoynte my bodi in to biriyng.
Treuli Y seie to you, where euer this gospel be prechid in al the world, and that that `this womman hath don, schal be told in to mynde of hym.
And Judas Scarioth, oon of the twelue, wente to the hiyest prestis, to bitraye hym to hem.
And thei herden, and ioyeden, and bihiyten to yyue hym money. And he souyt hou he schulde bitraye hym couenabli.
And the firste dai of therf looues, whanne thei offriden pask, the disciplis seyn to hym, Whidir `wilt thou that we go, and make redi to thee, that thou ete the pask?
And he sendith tweyn of hise disciplis, and seith to hem, Go ye in to the citee, and a man berynge a galoun of watir schal meete you; sue ye hym.
And whidur euer he entrith, seie ye to the lord of the hous, That the maister seith, Where is myn etynge place, where Y schal ete pask with my disciplis?
And he schal schewe to you a grete soupyng place arayed, and there make ye redi to vs.
And hise disciplis wenten forth, and camen in to the citee, and founden as he hadde seid to hem; and thei maden redy the pask.
And whanne the euentid was come, he cam with the twelue.
And whanne thei saten `at the mete, and eeten, Jhesus seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that oon of you that etith with me, schal bitray me.
And thei bigunnen to be sori, and to seie to hym, ech bi hem silf, Whether Y?
Which seide to hem, Oon of twelue that puttith the hoond with me in the platere.
And sotheli mannus sone goith, as it is writun of hym; but wo to that man, by whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed. It were good to hym, yf thilke man hadde not be borun.
And while thei eeten, Jhesus took breed, and blessid, and brak, and yaf to hem, and seide, Take ye; this is my bodi.
And whanne he hadde take the cuppe, he dide thankyngis, and yaf to hem, and alle dronken therof.
And he seide to hem, This is my blood of the newe testament, which schal be sched for many.
Treuli Y seye to you, for now Y schal not drynke of this fruyt of vyne, in to that dai whane Y schal drynke it newe in the rewme of God.
And whanne the ympne was seid, thei wenten out in to the hil of Olyues.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Alle ye schulen be sclaundrid in me in this nyyt; for it is writun, Y schal smyte the scheepherde, and the scheep of the flok schulen be disparplid.
But aftir that Y schal rise ayen, Y schal go bifor you in to Galilee.
And Petir seide to hym, Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid, but not Y.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to thee, that to dai bifore that the cok in this niyt crowe twies, thou schalt thries denye me.
But he seide more, Thouy it bihoueth, that Y die togider with thee, Y schal not forsake thee. And in lijk maner alle seiden.
And thei camen in to a place, whos name is Gethsamany. And he seide to hise disciplis, Sitte ye here, while Y preye.
And he took Petir and James and Joon with hym, and bigan to drede, and to be anoyed.
And he seide to hem, My soule is soreweful to the deeth; abide ye here, and wake ye with me.
And whanne he was gon forth a litil, he felde doun on the erthe, and preiede, that if it myyte be, that the our schulde passe fro hym.
And he seide, Abba, fadir, alle thingis ben possible to thee, bere ouer fro me this cuppe; but not that Y wole, but that thou wolt, be don.
And he cam, and foond hem slepynge. And he seide to Petir, Symount, slepist thou? myytist thou not wake with me oon our?
Wake ye, and `preie ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun; for the spirit is redi, but the fleische is sijk.
And eftsoone he yede, and preiede, and seide the same word;
and turnede ayen eftsoone, and foond hem slepynge; for her iyen weren heuyed. And thei knewen not, what thei schulden answere to hym.
And he cam the thridde tyme, and seide to hem, Slepe ye now, and reste ye; it suffisith. The hour is comun; lo! mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of synful men.
Rise ye, go we; lo! he that schal bitraye me is nyy.
And yit while he spak, Judas Scarioth, oon of the twelue, cam, and with him miche puple with swerdis and staues, sent fro the hiyest prestis, and the scribis, and fro the eldre men.
And his traytour hadde youun to hem a tokene, and seide, Whom euer Y kisse, he it is; holde ye hym, and lede ye warli.
And whanne he cam, anoon he came to hym, and seide, Maistir; and he kisside hym.
And thei leiden hondis on hym, and helden hym.
But oon of the men that stoden aboute, drowy out a swerd, and smoot the seruaunt of the hiyest preest, and kittide of his eere.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues, to take me?
Dai bi dai Y was among you, and tauyte in the temple, and ye helden not me; but that the scripturis be fulfillid.
Thanne alle hise disciplis forsoken hym, and fledden.
But a yong man, clothid with lynnun cloth on the bare, suede hym; and thei helden hym.
And he lefte the lynnyn clothing, and fleiy nakid awei fro hem.
And thei ledden Jhesu to the hiyest preest. And alle the prestis and scribis and eldere men camen togidir.
But Petir suede hym afer in to the halle of the hiyest preest. And he sat with the mynystris, and warmede hym at the fier.
And the hiyest prestis, and al the counsel, souyten witnessyng ayens Jhesu to take hym to the deeth; but thei founden not.
For manye seiden fals witnessyng ayens hym, and the witnessyngis weren not couenable.
And summe risen vp, and baren fals witnessyng ayens hym,
and seiden, For we `han herd hym seiynge, Y schal vndo this temple maad with hondis, and aftir the thridde dai Y schal bilde another not maad with hondis.
And the witnessyng `of hem was not couenable.
And the hiyest prest roos vp in to the myddil, and axide Jhesu, and seide, Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis that ben put ayens thee of these?
But he was stille, and answeride no thing. Eftsoone the hiyest prest axide hym, and seide to hym, Art thou Crist, the sone of the blessid God?
And Jhesus seide to hym, Y am; and ye schulen se mannus sone sittynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God, and comynge in the cloudis of heuene.
And the hiyest preest torente hise clothis, and seide, What yit dissiren we witnessis?
Ye han herd blasfemye. What semeth to you? And thei alle condempneden hym to be gilti of deeth.
And summe bigunnen to bispete hym, `and to hile his face, and to smite hym with buffetis, and seie to hym, Areede thou. And the mynystris beeten hym with strokis.
And whanne Petir was in the halle bynethen, oon of the damesels of the hiyest prest cam.
And whanne sche hadde seyn Petir warmynge hym, sche bihelde hym, and seide, And thou were with Jhesu of Nazareth.
And he denyede, and seide, Nethir Y woot, nethir Y knowe, what thou seist. And he wente without forth bifor the halle; and anoon the cok crewe.
And eftsoone whanne another damesel hadde seyn hym, sche bigan to seye to men that stoden aboute, That this is of hem.
And he eftsoone denyede. And aftir a litil, eftsoone thei that stoden nyy, seiden to Petir, Verili thou art of hem, for thou art of Galilee also.
But he bigan to curse and to swere, For Y knowe not this man, whom ye seien.
And anoon eftsoones the cok crew. And Petir bithouyte on the word that Jhesus hadde seide to hym, Bifor the cok crowe twies, thries thou schalt denye me. And he bigan to wepe.
And anoon in the morewtid the hiyeste prestis maden a counsel with the elder men, and the scribis, and with al the counsel, and bounden Jhesu and ledden, and bitoken hym to Pilat.
And Pilat axide hym, Art thou kynge of Jewis? And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou seist.
And the hieste prestis accusiden hym in many thingis.
But Pilat eftsoone axide hym, and seide, Answerist thou no thing? Seest thou in hou many thingis thei accusen thee?
But Jhesus answeride no more, so that Pilat wondride.
But bi the feeste dai he was wont to leeue to hem oon of men boundun, whom euer thei axiden.
And `oon ther was that was seid Barabas, that was boundun with men of dissencioun, that hadden don manslauytir in seducioun.
And whanne the puple was gon vp, he bigan to preie, as he euer more dide to hem.
And Pilat answeride `to hem, and seide, Wolen ye Y leeue to you the kyng of Jewis?
For he wiste, that the hiyeste prestis hadden takun hym bi enuye.
But the bischopis stireden the puple, that he schulde rather leeue to hem Barabas.
And eftsoone Pilat answerde, and seide to hem, What thanne wolen ye that Y schal do to the kyng of Jewis?
And thei eftsoone crieden, Crucifie hym.
But Pilat seide to hem, What yuel hath he don? And thei crieden the more, Crucifie hym.
And Pilat, willynge to make aseeth to the puple, lefte to hem Barabas, and bitok to hem Jhesu, betun with scourgis, to be crucified.
And knyytis ledden hym with ynneforth, in to the porche of the mote halle. And thei clepiden togidir al the cumpany of knyytis,
and clothiden hym with purpur. And thei writhen a coroun of thornes, and puttiden on hym.
And thei bigunnen to grete hym, and seiden, Heile, thou kyng of Jewis.
And thei smyten his heed with a reed, and bispatten hym; and thei kneliden, and worschipiden hym.
And aftir that thei hadden scorned him, thei vnclothiden hym of purpur, and clothiden hym with hise clothis, and ledden out hym, to crucifie hym.
And thei compelliden a man that passide the weie, that cam fro the toun, Symount of Syrenen, the fader of Alisaundir and of Rufe, to bere his cross.
And thei ledden hym in to a place Golgatha, that is to seie, the place of Caluari.
And thei yauen to hym to drynke wyn meddlid with mirre, and he took not.
And thei crucifieden him, and departiden hise clothis, and kesten lot on tho, who schulde take what.
And it was the thridde our, and thei crucifieden hym.
And the titil of his cause was writun, Kyng of Jewis.
And thei crucifien with hym twei theues, oon `at the riythalf and oon at his lefthalf.
And the scripture was fulfillid that seith, And he is ordeyned with wickid men.
And as thei passiden forth, thei blasfemyden hym, mouynge her heedis, and seiynge, Vath! thou that distriest the temple of God, and in `thre daies bildist it ayen;
come adoun fro the crosse, and make thi silf saaf.
Also the hiyeste prestis scorneden hym ech to othir with the scribis, and seiden, He made othir men saaf, he may not saue hym silf.
Crist, kyng of Israel, come doun now fro the cross, that we seen, and bileuen. And thei that weren crucified with hym, dispiseden hym.
And whanne the sixte hour was come, derknessis weren made on al the erthe til in to the nynthe our.
And in the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois, and seide, Heloy, Heloy, lamasabatany, that is to seie, My God, my God, whi hast thou forsakun me?
And summe of men that stoden aboute herden, and seiden, Lo! he clepith Helye.
And oon ranne, and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide aboute to a reede, and yaf to hym drynke, and seide, Suffre ye, se we, if Helie come to do hym doun.
And Jhesus yaf out a greet cry, and diede.
And the veil of the temple was rent atwo fro the hiyeste to bynethe.
But the centurien that stood forn ayens siy, that he so criynge hadde diede, and seide, Verili, this man was Goddis sone.
And ther weren also wymmen biholdynge fro afer, among whiche was Marie Maudeleyn, and Marie, the modir of James the lesse, and of Joseph, and of Salome.
And whanne Jhesus was in Galilee, thei folewiden hym, and mynystriden to hym, and many othere wymmen, that camen vp togidir with him to Jerusalem.
And whanne euentid was come, for it was the euentid which is bifor the sabat,
Joseph of Armathie, the noble decurioun, cam, and he abood the rewme of God; and booldli he entride to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu.
But Pilat wondride, if he were now deed.
And whanne the centurion was clepid, he axide hym, if he were deed; and whanne he knewe of the centurion, he grauntide the bodi of Jhesu to Joseph.
And Joseph bouyte lynnen cloth, and took hym doun, and wlappide in the lynnen cloth, and leide hym in a sepulcre that was hewun of a stoon, and walewide a stoon to the dore of the sepulcre.
And Marie Maudeleyne and Marie of Joseph bihelden, where he was leid.
And whanne the sabat was passid, Marie Maudeleyne, and Marie of James, and Salomee bouyten swete smellynge oynementis, to come and to anoynte Jhesu.
And ful eerli in oon of the woke daies, thei camen to the sepulcre, whanne the sunne was risun.
And thei seiden togidere, Who schal meue awey to vs the stoon fro the dore of the sepulcre?
And thei bihelden, and seien the stoon walewid awei, for it was ful greet.
And thei yeden in to the sepulcre, and sayn a yonglyng, hilide with a white stole, sittynge `at the riythalf; and thei weren afeerd.
Which seith to hem, Nyle ye drede; ye seken Jhesu of Nazareth crucified; he is risun, he is not here; lo! the place where thei leiden hym.
But go ye, and seie ye to hise disciplis, and to Petir, that he schal go bifor you in to Galilee; there ye schulen se hym, as he seide to you.
And thei yeden out, and fledden fro the sepulcre; for drede and quakyng had assailed hem, and to no man thei seiden ony thing, for thei dredden.
And Jhesus roos eerli the firste dai of the woke, and apperid firste to Marie Maudeleyne, fro whom he had caste out seuene deuelis.
And sche yede, and tolde to hem that hadden ben with hym, whiche weren weilynge and wepynge.
And thei herynge that he lyuyde, and was seyn of hir, bileueden not.
But after these thingis whanne tweyne of hem wandriden, he was schewid in anothir liknesse to hem goynge in to a toun.
And thei yeden, and telden to the othir, and nether thei bileueden to hem.
But `at the laste, whanne the enleuene disciplis saten at the mete, Jhesus apperide to hem, and repreuede the vnbileue of hem, and the hardnesse of herte, for thei bileueden not to hem, that hadden seyn that he was risun fro deeth.
And he seide to hem, Go ye in to al the world, and preche the gospel to eche creature.
Who that bileueth, and is baptisid, schal be saaf; but he that bileueth not, schal be dampned.
And these tokenes schulen sue hem, that bileuen. In my name thei schulen caste out feendis; thei schulen speke with newe tungis;
thei schulen do awei serpentis; and if thei drynke ony venym, it schal not noye hem. Thei schulen sette her hondis on sijk men, and thei schulen wexe hoole.
And the Lord Jhesu, aftir he hadde spokun to hem, was takun vp in to heuene, and he sittith on the riythalf of God.
And thei yeden forth, and prechiden euery where, for the Lord wrouyte with hem, and confermyde the word with signes folewynge.
Forsothe for manye men enforceden to ordeyne the tellyng of thingis, whiche ben fillid in vs,
as thei that seyn atte the bigynnyng, and weren ministris of the word,
bitaken, it is seen also to me, hauynge alle thingis diligentli bi ordre, to write to thee,
thou best Theofile, that thou knowe the treuthe of tho wordis, of whiche thou art lerned.
In the daies of Eroude, kyng of Judee, ther was a prest, Sakarie bi name, of the sorte of Abia, and his wijf was of the douytris of Aaron, and hir name was Elizabeth.
And bothe weren iust bifor God, goynge in alle the maundementis and iustifiyngis of the Lord, withouten pleynt.
And thei hadden no child, for Elizabeth was bareyn, and bothe weren of grete age in her daies.
And it bifel, that whanne Zacarie schulde do the office of preesthod, in the ordre of his cours tofor God,
aftir the custome of the preesthod, he wente forth bi lot, and entride in to the temple, to encense.
And al the multitude of the puple was with outforth, and preiede in the our of encensyng.
And an aungel of the Lord apperide to hym, and stood on the riythalf of the auter of encense.
And Zacarie seynge was afraied, and drede fel vpon hym.
And the aungel seide to hym, Zacarie, drede thou not; for thi preyer is herd, and Elizabeth, thi wijf, schal bere to thee a sone, and his name schal be clepid Joon.
And ioye and gladyng schal be to thee; and many schulen `haue ioye in his natyuyte.
For he schal be greet bifor the Lord, and he schal not drynke wyn and sidir, and he schal be fulfillid with the Hooli Goost yit of his modir wombe.
And he schal conuerte many of the children of Israel to her Lord God;
and he schal go bifor hym in the spirit and the vertu of Helie; and he schal turne the hertis of the fadris in to the sones, and men out of bileue to the prudence of iust men, to make redi a perfit puple to the Lord.
And Zacarie seide to the aungel, Wherof schal Y wite this? for Y am eld, and my wijf hath gon fer in to hir daies.
And the aungel answeride, and seide to hym, For Y am Gabriel, that stonde niy bifor God; and Y am sent to thee to speke, and to euangelize to thee these thingis.
And lo! thou schalt be doumbe, and thou schalt not mow speke til in to the dai, in which these thingis schulen be don; for thou hast not bileued to my wordis, whiche schulen be fulfillid in her tyme.
And the puple was abidynge Zacarie, and thei wondriden, that he tariede in the temple.
And he yede out, and myyte not speke to hem, and thei knewen that he hadde seyn a visioun in the temple. And he bikenyde to hem, and he dwellide stille doumbe.
And it was don, whanne the daies of his office weren fulfillid, he wente in to his hous.
And aftir these daies Elizabeth, his wijf, conseyuede, and hidde hir fyue monethis, and seide,
For so the Lord dide to me in the daies, in whiche he bihelde, to take awei my repreef among men.
But in the sixte moneth the aungel Gabriel was sent fro God in to a citee of Galilee, whos name was Nazareth,
to a maidyn, weddid to a man, whos name was Joseph, of the hous of Dauid; and the name of the maidun was Marie.
And the aungel entride to hir, and seide, Heil, ful of grace; the Lord be with thee; blessid be thou among wymmen.
And whanne sche hadde herd, sche was troublid in his word, and thouyte what maner salutacioun this was.
And the aungel seide to hir, Ne drede thou not, Marie, for thou hast foundun grace anentis God.
Lo! thou schalt conceyue in wombe, and schalt bere a sone, and thou schalt clepe his name Jhesus.
This schal be greet, and he schal be clepid the sone of the Hiyeste; and the Lord God schal yeue to hym the seete of Dauid, his fadir, and he schal regne in the hous of Jacob with outen ende,
and of his rewme schal be noon ende.
And Marie seide to the aungel, On what maner schal this thing be doon, for Y knowe not man?
And the aungel answeride, and seide to hir, The Hooly Goost schal come fro aboue in to thee, and the vertu of the Hiyeste schal ouerschadewe thee; and therfor that hooli thing that schal be borun of thee, schal be clepid the sone of God.
And lo! Elizabeth, thi cosyn, and sche also hath conceyued a sone in hir eelde, and this moneth is the sixte to hir that is clepid bareyn;
for euery word schal not be inpossible anentis God.
And Marie seide, Lo! the handmaydyn of the Lord; be it don to me aftir thi word. And the aungel departide fro hir.
And Marie roos vp in tho daies, and wente with haaste in to the mounteyns, in to a citee of Judee.
And sche entride in to the hous of Zacarie, and grette Elizabeth.
And it was don, as Elizabeth herde the salutacioun of Marie, the yong child in hir wombe gladide. And Elizabeth was fulfillid with the Hooli Goost,
and criede with a greet vois, and seide, Blessid be thou among wymmen, and blessid be the fruyt of thi wombe.
And whereof is this thing to me, that the modir of my Lord come to me?
For lo! as the voice of thi salutacioun was maad in myn eeris, the yong child gladide in ioye in my wombe.
And blessid be thou, that hast bileued, for thilke thingis that ben seid of the Lord to thee, schulen be parfitli don.
And Marie seide, Mi soule magnyfieth the Lord,
and my spirit hath gladid in God, myn helthe.
For he hath biholdun the mekenesse of his handmaidun.
For lo! of this alle generaciouns schulen seie that Y am blessid. For he that is myyti hath don to me grete thingis, and his name is hooli.
And his mercy is fro kynrede in to kynredes, to men that dreden hym.
He made myyt in his arme, he scaterede proude men with the thouyte of his herte.
He sette doun myyti men fro sete, and enhaunside meke men.
He hath fulfillid hungri men with goodis, and he hath left riche men voide.
He, hauynge mynde of his mercy, took Israel, his child;
as he hath spokun to oure fadris, to Abraham and to his seed, in to worldis.
And Marie dwellide with hir, as it were thre monethis, and turnede ayen in to hir hous.
But the tyme of beryng child was fulfillid to Elizabeth, and sche bare a sone.
And the neiyboris and cosyns of hir herden, that the Lord hadde magnyfied his mercy with hir; and thei thankiden hym.
And it was don in the eiyte dai, thei camen to circumcide the child; and thei clepiden hym Zacarie, bi the name of his fadir.
And his moder answeride, and seide, Nay, but he schal be clepid Joon.
And thei seiden to hir, For no man is in thi kynrede, that is clepid this name.
And thei bikeneden to his fadir, what he wolde that he were clepid.
And he axynge a poyntil, wroot, seiynge, Joon is his name.
And alle men wondriden. And anoon his mouth was openyd, and his tunge, and he spak, and blesside God.
And drede was maad on alle her neiyboris, and alle these wordis weren pupplischid on alle the mounteyns of Judee.
And alle men that herden puttiden in her herte, and seiden, What maner child schal this be? For the hoond of the Lord was with hym.
And Zacarie, his fadir, was fulfillid with the Hooli Goost, and prophesiede,
and seide, Blessid be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visitid, and maad redempcioun of his puple.
And he hath rerid to vs an horn of heelthe in the hous of Dauid, his child.
As he spak bi the mouth of hise hooli prophetis, that weren fro the world.
Helthe fro oure enemyes, and fro the hoond of alle men that hatiden vs.
To do merci with oure fadris, and to haue mynde of his hooli testament.
The greet ooth that he swoor to Abraham, oure fadir, to yyue hym silf to vs.
That we with out drede delyuered fro the hoond of oure enemyes,
serue to hym, in hoolynesse and riytwisnesse bifor hym in alle oure daies.
And thou, child, schalt be clepid the prophete of the Hiyest; for thou schalt go bifor the face of the Lord, to make redi hise weies.
To yyue scyence of helthe to his puple, in to remyssioun of her synnes;
bi the inwardnesse of the merci of oure God, in the whiche he spryngynge vp fro an hiy hath visitid vs.
To yyue liyt to hem that sitten in derknessis and in schadewe of deeth; to dresse oure feet in to the weie of pees.
And the child wexide, and was coumfortid in spirit, and was in desert placis `til to the dai of his schewing to Israel.
And it was don in tho daies, a maundement wente out fro the emperour August, that al the world schulde be discryued.
This firste discryuyng was maad of Cyryn, iustice of Sirie.
And alle men wenten to make professioun, ech in to his owne citee.
And Joseph wente vp fro Galilee, fro the citee Nazareth, in to Judee, in to a citee of Dauid, that is clepid Bethleem, for that he was of the hous and of the meyne of Dauid,
that he schulde knouleche with Marie, his wijf, that was weddid to hym, and was greet with child.
And it was don, while thei weren there, the daies weren fulfillid, that sche schulde bere child.
And sche bare hir first borun sone, and wlappide hym in clothis, and leide hym in a cratche, for ther was no place to hym in no chaumbir.
And scheepherdis weren in the same cuntre, wakynge and kepynge the watchis of the nyyt on her flok.
And lo! the aungel of the Lord stood bisidis hem, and the cleernesse of God schinede aboute hem; and thei dredden with greet drede.
And the aungel seide to hem, Nyle ye drede; for lo! Y preche to you a greet ioye, that schal be to al puple.
For a sauyoure is borun to dai to you, that is Crist the Lord, in the citee of Dauid.
And this is a tokene to you; ye schulen fynde a yong child wlappid in clothis, and leid in a cratche.
And sudenli ther was maad with the aungel a multitude of heuenli knyythod, heriynge God,
and seiynge, Glorie be in the hiyeste thingis to God, and in erthe pees be to men of good wille.
And it was don, as the `aungelis passiden awei fro hem in to heuene, the scheephirdis spaken togider, and seiden, Go we ouer to Bethleem, and se we this word that is maad, which the Lord hath `maad, and schewide to vs.
And thei hiyynge camen, and founden Marie and Joseph, and the yong child leid in a cratche.
And thei seynge, knewen of the word that was seid to hem of this child.
And alle men that herden wondriden, and of these thingis that weren seid to hem of the scheephirdis.
But Marie kepte alle these wordis, berynge togider in hir herte.
And the scheepherdis turneden ayen, glorifyinge and heriynge God in alle thingis that thei hadden herd and seyn, as it was seid to hem.
And aftir that the eiyte daies weren endid, that the child schulde be circumcided, his name was clepid Jhesus, which was clepid of the aungel, bifor that he was conceyued in the wombe.
And aftir that the daies of the purgacioun of Marie weren fulfillid, aftir Moyses lawe, thei token hym into Jerusalem, to offre hym to the Lord, as it is writun in the lawe of the Lord,
For euery male kynde openynge the wombe, schal be clepid holi to the Lord; and that thei schulen yyue an offryng,
aftir that it is seid in the lawe of the Lord, A peire of turturis, or twei culuer briddis.
And lo! a man was in Jerusalem, whos name was Symeon; and this man was iust and vertuous, and aboode the coumfort of Israel; and the Hooli Goost was in hym.
And he hadde takun an answere of the Hooli Goost, that he schulde not se deeth, but he sawy first the Crist of the Lord.
And he cam in spirit into the temple. And whanne his fadir and modir ledden the child Jhesu to do aftir the custom of the lawe for hym,
he took hym in to hise armes, and he blesside God,
and seide, Lord, now thou leuyst thi seruaunt aftir thi word in pees;
for myn iyen han seyn thin helthe,
which thou hast maad redi bifor the face of alle puplis;
liyt to the schewyng of hethene men, and glorie of thi puple Israel.
And his fadir and his modir weren wondrynge on these thingis, that weren seid of hym.
And Symeon blesside hem, and seide to Marie, his modir, Lo! this is set in to the fallyng doun and in to the risyng ayen of many men in Israel, and in to a tokene, to whom it schal be ayenseid.
And a swerd schal passe thorou thin owne soule, that the thouytis ben schewid of many hertis.
And Anna was a prophetesse, the douytir of Fanuel, of the lynage of Aser. And sche hadde goon forth in many daies, and hadde lyued with hir hosebonde seuene yeer fro hir maydynhode.
And this was a widewe to foure scoor yeer and foure; and sche departide not fro the temple, but seruyde to God nyyt and dai in fastyngis and preieris.
And this cam vpon hem in thilk our, and knoulechide to the Lord, and spak of hym to alle that abiden the redempcioun of Israel.
And as thei hadden ful don alle thingis, aftir the lawe of the Lord, thei turneden ayen in to Galilee, in to her citee Nazareth.
And the child wexe, and was coumfortid, ful of wisdom; and the grace of God was in hym.
And his fadir and modir wenten ech yeer in to Jerusalem, in the solempne dai of pask.
And whanne Jhesus was twelue yeer oold, thei wenten vp to Jerusalem, aftir the custom of the feeste dai.
And whanne the daies weren don, thei turneden ayen; and the child abood in Jerusalem, and his fadir and modir knewen it not.
For thei gessynge that he hadde be in the felowschip, camen a daies iourney, and souyten hym among hise cosyns and hise knouleche.
And whanne thei founden hym not, thei turneden ayen in to Jerusalem, and souyten hym.
And it bifelle, that aftir the thridde dai thei founden hym in the temple, sittynge in the myddil of the doctours, herynge hem and axynge hem.
And alle men that herden hym, wondriden on the prudence and the answeris of hym.
And thei seyn, and wondriden. And his modir seide to hym, Sone, what hast thou do to vs thus? Lo! thi fadir and Y sorewynge han souyte thee.
And he seide to hem, What is it that ye souyten me? wisten ye not that in tho thingis that ben of my fadir, it behoueth me to be?
And thei vndurstoden not the word, which he spak to hem.
And he cam doun with hem, and cam to Nazareth, and was suget to hem. And his moder kepte togidir alle these wordis, and bare hem in hir herte.
And Jhesus profitide in wisdom, age, and grace, anentis God and men.
In the fiftenthe yeer of the empire of Tiberie, the emperoure, whanne Pilat of Pounce gouernede Judee, and Eroude was prince of Galilee, and Filip, his brothir, was prince of Iturye, and of the cuntre of Tracon, and Lisanye was prince of Abilyn,
vndir the princis of prestis Annas and Caifas, the word of the Lord was maad on Joon, the sone of Zacarie, in desert.
And he cam in to al the cuntre of Jordan, and prechide baptym of penaunce in to remyssioun of synnes.
As it is wrytun in the book of the wordis of Isaye, the prophete, The voice of a crier in desert, Make ye redi the weie of the Lord, make ye hise pathis riyt.
Ech valey schal be fulfillid, and euery hil and litil hil schal be maad lowe; and schrewid thingis schulen ben in to dressid thingis, and scharp thingis in to pleyn weies;
and euery fleisch schal se the heelthe of God.
Therfor he seid to the puple, which wente out to be baptisid of hym, Kyndlyngis of eddris, who schewide to you to fle fro the wraththe to comynge?
Therfor do ye worthi fruytis of penaunce, and bigynne ye not to seie, We han a fadir Abraham; for Y seie to you, that God is myyti to reise of these stoonys the sones of Abraham.
And now an axe is sett to the roote of the tree; and therfor euery tre that makith no good fruyt, schal be kit doun, and schal be cast in to the fier.
And the puple axide hym, and seiden, What thanne schulen we do?
He answeride, and seide to hem, He that hath twei cootis, yyue to hym that hath noon; and he that hath metis, do in lijk maner.
And pupplicans camen to be baptisid; and thei seiden to hym, Maister, what schulen we do?
And he seide to hem, Do ye no thing more, than that that is ordeyned to you.
And knyytis axiden hym, and seiden, What schulen also we do? And he seide to hem, Smyte ye wrongfuli no man, nethir make ye fals chalenge, and be ye apayed with youre sowdis.
Whanne al the puple gesside, and alle men thouyten in her hertis of Joon, lest perauenture he were Crist,
Joon answeride, and seide to alle men, Y baptize you in watir; but a stronger than Y schal come aftir me, of whom Y am not worthi to vnbynde the lace of his schoon; he schal baptize you in the Hooli Goost and fier.
Whos `wynewyng tool in his hond, and he schal purge his floor of corn, and schal gadere the whete in to his berne; but the chaffis he schal brenne with fier vnquenchable.
And many othere thingis also he spak, and prechide to the puple. But Eroude tetrark, whanne he was blamed of Joon for Erodias,
the wijf of his brother, and for alle the yuelis that Eroude dide,
encreside this ouer alle, and schitte Joon in prisoun.
And it was don, whanne al the puple was baptised, and whanne Jhesu was baptised, and preiede, heuene was openyd.
And the Hooli Goost cam doun in bodili licnesse, as a dowue on hym; and a vois was maad fro heuene, Thou art my derworth sone, in thee it hath plesid to me.
And Jhesu hym silf was bigynninge as of thritti yeer, that he was gessid the sone of Joseph, which was of Heli,
which was of Mathath, which was of Leuy, which was of Melchi, that was of Jamne,
that was of Joseph, that was of Matatie, that was of Amos, that was of Naum, that was of Hely, that was of Nagge,

that was of Seth, that was of Adam, that was of God.
And Jhesus ful of the Hooli Goost turnede ayen fro Jordan, and was led bi the spirit into desert fourti daies,
and was temptid of the deuel, and eet nothing in tho daies; and whanne tho daies weren endid, he hungride.
And the deuel seide to him, If thou art Goddis sone, seie to this stoon, that it be maad breed.
And Jhesus answeride to hym, It is writun, That a man lyueth not in breed aloone, but in euery word of God.
And the deuel ladde hym in to an hiy hil, and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world in a moment of tyme;
and seide to hym, Y schal yyue to thee al this power, and the glorie of hem, for to me thei ben youun, and to whom Y wole, Y yyue hem;
therfor if thou falle doun, and worschipe bifore me, alle thingis schulen be thine.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, It is writun, Thou schalt worschipe thi Lord God, and to hym aloone thou schalt serue.
And he ledde hym in to Jerusalem, and sette hym on the pynacle of the temple, and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, sende thi silf fro hennes doun;
for it is writun, For he hath comaundide to hise aungels of thee, that thei kepe thee in alle thi weies,
and that thei schulen take thee in hondis, lest perauenture thou hirte thi foote at a stoon.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to him, It is seid, Thou schalt not tempte thi Lord God.
And whanne euery temptacioun was endid, the feend wente a wei fro hym for a tyme.
And Jhesus turnede ayen in the vertu of the spirit in to Galilee, and the fame wente forth of hym thorou al the cuntre.
And he tauyte in the synagogis of hem, and was magnyfied of alle men.
And he cam to Nazareth, where he was norisschid, and entride aftir his custom in the sabat dai in to a synagoge, and roos to reed.
And the book of Ysaye, the prophete, was takun to hym; and as he turnede the book, he foond a place, where it was wrytun,
The Spirit of the Lord on me, for which thing he anoyntide me; he sente me to preche to pore men, to hele contrite men in herte,
and to preche remyssioun to prisoneris, and siyt to blynde men, and to delyuere brokun men in to remissioun; to preche the yeer of the Lord plesaunt, and the dai of yeldyng ayen.
And whanne he hadde closid the book, he yaf ayen to the mynystre, and sat; and the iyen of alle men in the synagoge were biholdynge in to hym.
And he bigan to seie to hem, For in this dai this scripture is fulfillid in youre eeris.
And alle men yauen witnessyng to hym, and wondriden in the wordis of grace, that camen forth of his mouth. And thei seiden, Whether this is not the sone of Joseph?
And he seide to hem, Sotheli ye schulen seie to me this liknesse, Leeche, heele thi silf. The Farisees seiden to Jhesu, Hou grete thingis han we herd don in Cafarnaum, do thou also here in thi cuntre.
And he seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that no profete is resseyued in his owne cuntre.
In treuthe Y seie to you, that many widowis weren in the daies of Elie, the prophete, in Israel, whanne heuene was closid thre yeer and sixe monethis, whanne greet hungur was maad in al the erthe;
and to noon of hem was Elye sent, but in to Sarepta of Sydon, to a widowe.
And many meseles weren in Israel, vndur Helisee, the prophete, and noon of hem was clensid, but Naaman of Sirye.
And alle in the synagoge herynge these thingis, weren fillid with wraththe.
And thei risen vp, and drouen hym out with out the citee, and ledden hym to the cop of the hil on which her citee was bildid, to caste hym doun.
But Jhesus passide, and wente thorou the myddil of hem; and cam doun in to Cafarnaum,
a citee of Galilee, and there he tauyte hem in sabotis.
And thei weren astonyed in his techyng, for his word was in power.
And in her synagoge was a man hauynge an vnclene feend, and he criede with greet vois,
and seide, Suffre, what to vs and to thee, Jhesu of Nazareth? art thou comun to leese vs? Y knowe, that thou art the hooli of God.
And Jhesus blamede hym, and seide, Wexe doumbe, and go out fro hym. And whanne the feend hadde cast hym forth in to the myddil, he wente a wei fro hym, and he noyede hym no thing.
And drede was maad in alle men, and thei spaken togider, and seiden, What is this word, for in power and vertu he comaundith to vnclene spiritis, and thei gon out?
And the fame was pupplischid of him in to ech place of the cuntre.
And Jhesus roos vp fro the synagoge, and entride in to the hous of Symount; and the modir of Symountis wijf was holdun with grete fyueris, and thei preieden hym for hir.
And Jhesus stood ouer hir, and comaundide to the feuer, and it lefte hir; and anoon sche roos vp, and seruede hem.
And whanne the sunne wente doun, alle that hadden sijke men with dyuerse langours, ledden hem to hym; and he sette his hoondis on ech bi `hem silf, and heelide hem.
And feendis wenten out fro manye, and crieden, and seiden, For thou art the sone of God. And he blamede, and suffride hem not to speke, for thei wisten hym, that he was Crist.
And whanne the dai was come, he yede out, and wente in to a desert place; and the puple souyten hym, and thei camen to hym, and thei helden hym, that he schulde not go a wei fro hem.
To whiche he seide, For also to othere citees it bihoueth me to preche the kyngdom of God, for therfor Y am sent.
And he prechide in the synagogis of Galilee.
And it was don, whanne the puple cam fast to Jhesu, to here the word of God, he stood bisidis the pool of Genasereth,
and saiy two bootis stondynge bisidis the pool; and the fischeris weren go doun, and waischiden her nettis.
And he wente vp in to a boot, that was Symoundis, and preiede hym to lede it a litil fro the loond; and he seet, and tauyte the puple out of the boot.
And as he ceesside to speke, he seide to Symount, Lede thou in to the depthe, and slake youre nettis to take fisch.
And Symount answeride, and seide to hym, Comaundoure, we traueliden al the nyyt, and token no thing, but in thi word Y schal leye out the net.
And whanne thei hadden do this thing, thei closiden togidir a greet multitude of fischis; and her net was brokun.
And thei bikenyden to felawis, that weren in anothir boot, that thei schulden come, and helpe hem. And thei camen, and filliden bothe the bootis, so that thei weren almost drenchid.
And whanne Symount Petir saiy this thing, he felde doun to the knees of Jhesu, and seide, Lord, go fro me, for Y am a synful man.
For he was on ech side astonyed, and alle that weren with hym, in the takyng of fischis whiche thei token.
Sotheli in lijk maner James and Joon, the sones of Zebedee, that weren felowis of Symount Petre. And Jhesus seide to Symount, Nyle thou drede; now fro this tyme thou schalt take men.
And whanne the bootis weren led vp to the loond, thei leften alle thingis, and thei sueden hym.
And it was don, whanne he was in oon of the citees, lo! a man ful of lepre; and seynge Jhesu felle doun on his face, and preyede hym, and seide, Lord, if thou wolt, thou maist make me clene.
And Jhesus held forth his hoond, and touchide hym, and seide, Y wole, be thou maad cleene. And anoon the lepre passide awei fro hym.
And Jhesus comaundide to hym, that he schulde seie to no man; But go, schewe thou thee to a preest, and offre for thi clensyng, as Moises bad, in to witnessyng to hem.
And the word walkide aboute the more of hym; and myche puple camen togidere, to here, and to be heelid of her siknessis.
And he wente in to desert, and preiede.
And it was don in oon of the daies, he sat, and tauyte; and there weren Farisees sittynge, and doctouris of the lawe, that camen of eche castel of Galilee, and of Judee, and of Jerusalem; and the vertu of the Lord was to heele sike men.
And lo! men beren in a bed a man that was sijk in the palsye, and thei souyten to bere hym in, and sette bifor hym.
And thei founden not in what partie thei schulden bere hym in, for the puple, `and thei wenten on the roof, and bi the sclattis thei leeten hym doun with the bed, in to the myddil, bifor Jhesus.
And whanne Jhesu saiy the feith of hem, he seide, Man, thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
And the scribis and Farisees bigunnen to thenke, seiynge, Who is this, that spekith blasfemyes? who may foryyue synnes, but God aloone?
And as Jhesus knewe the thouytis of hem, he answeride, and seide to hem, What thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertes?
What is liyter to seie, Synnes ben foryouun to thee, or to seie, Rise vp, and walke?
But that ye wite, that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes, he seide to the sijk man in palesie, Y seie to thee, ryse vp, take thi bed, and go in to thin hous.
And anoon he roos vp bifor hem, and took the bed in which he lay, and wente in to his hous, and magnyfiede God.
And greet wondur took alle, and thei magnyfieden God; and thei weren fulfillid with greet drede, and seiden, For we han seyn merueilouse thingis to dai.
And after these thingis Jhesus wente out, and saiy a pupplican, Leuy bi name, sittynge at the tolbothe. And he seide to hym, Sue thou me;
and whanne he hadde left alle thingis, he roos vp, and suede hym.
And Leuy made to hym a greet feeste in his hous; and ther was a greet cumpanye of pupplicans, and of othere that weren with hem, sittynge at the mete.
And Farisees and the scribis of hem grutchiden, and seiden to hise disciplis, Whi eten ye and drynken with pupplicans and synful men?
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Thei that ben hoole han no nede to a leche, but thei that ben sijke;
for Y cam not to clepe iuste men, but synful men to penaunce.
And thei seiden to hym, Whi the disciplis of Joon fasten ofte, and maken preieris, also and of Farisees, but thine eten and drynken?
To whiche he seide, Whether ye moun make the sones of the spouse to faste, while the spouse is with hem?
But daies schulen come, whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem, and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies.
And he seide to hem also a liknesse; For no man takith a pece fro a newe cloth, and puttith it in to an oold clothing; ellis bothe he brekith the newe, and the pece of the newe acordith not to the elde.
And no man puttith newe wyne in to oolde botels; ellis the newe wyn schal breke the botels, and the wyn schal be sched out, and the botels schulen perische.
But newe wyne owith to be put in to newe botels, and bothe ben kept.
And no man drynkynge the elde, wole anoon the newe; for he seith, The olde is the betere.
And it was don in the secounde firste sabat, whanne he passid bi cornes, hise disciplis pluckiden eeris of corn; and thei frotynge with her hondis, eeten.
And summe of the Farisees seiden to hem, What doon ye that, that is not leeueful in the sabotis?
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Han ye not redde, what Dauith dide, whanne he hungride, and thei that weren with hym;
hou he entride in to the hous of God, and took looues of proposicioun, and eet, and yaf to hem that weren with hem; whiche looues it was not leeueful to eete, but oonli to prestis.
And he seide to hem, For mannus sone is lord, yhe, of the sabat.
And it was don in another sabat, that he entride in to a synagoge, and tauyte. And a man was there, and his riyt hoond was drie.
And the scribis and Farisees aspieden hym, if he wolde heele hym in the sabat, that thei schulden fynde cause, whereof thei schulden accuse hym.
And he wiste the thouytis of hem, and he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond, Rise vp, and stonde in to the myddil. And he roos, and stood.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Y axe you, if it is leueful to do wel in the sabat, or yuel? to make a soule saaf, or to leese?
And whanne he hadde biholde alle men aboute, he seide to the man, Hold forth thin hoond. And he held forth, and his hond was restorid to helthe.
And thei weren fulfillid with vnwisdom, and spaken togidir, what thei schulden do of Jhesu.
And it was don in tho daies, he wente out in to an hil to preye; and he was al nyyt dwellynge in the preier of God.
And whanne the day was come, he clepide hise disciplis, and chees twelue of hem, whiche he clepide also apostlis;
Symount, whom he clepide Petir, and Andrew, his brothir, James and Joon,
Filip and Bartholomew, Matheu and Thomas, James Alphei, and Symount, that is clepid Zelotes,
Judas of James, and Judas Scarioth, that was traytoure.
And Jhesus cam doun fro the hil with hem, and stood in a feeldi place; and the cumpeny of hise disciplis, and a greet multitude of puple, of al Judee, and Jerusalem, and of the see coostis, and of Tyre and Sidon,
that camen to here hym, and to be heelid of her siknessis; and thei that weren trauelid of vncleene spiritis, weren heelid.
And al puple souyte to touche hym, for vertu wente out of hym, and heelide alle.
And whanne hise iyen weren cast vp in to hise disciplis, he seide, Blessid be ye, `pore men, for the kyngdom of God is youre.
Blessid be ye, that now hungren, for ye schulen be fulfillid. Blessid be ye, that now wepen, for ye schulen leiye.
Ye schulen be blessid, whanne men schulen hate you, and departe you awei, and putte schenschip to you, and cast out youre name as yuel, for mannus sone.
Joye ye in that dai, and be ye glad; for lo! youre meede is myche in heuene; for aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to prophetis.
Netheles wo to you, riche men, that han youre coumfort.
Wo to you that ben fulfillid, for ye schulen hungre. Wo to you that now leiyen, for ye schulen morne, and wepe.
Wo to you, whanne alle men schulen blesse you; aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to profetis.
But Y seie to you that heren, loue ye youre enemyes, do ye wel to hem that hatiden you;
blesse ye men that cursen you, preye ye for men that defamen you.
And to him that smytith thee on o cheeke, schewe also the tothir; and fro hym that takith awei fro thee a cloth, nyle thou forbede the coote.
And yyue to eche that axith thee, and if a man takith awei tho thingis that ben thine, axe thou not ayen.
And as ye wolen that men do to you, do ye also to hem in lijk maner.
And if ye louen hem that louen you, what thanke is to you? for synful men louen men that louen hem.
And if ye don wel to hem that don wel to you, what grace is to you? synful men don this thing.
And if ye leenen to hem of whiche ye hopen to take ayen, what thanke is to you? for synful men leenen to synful men, to take ayen as myche.
Netheles loue ye youre enemyes, and do ye wel, and leene ye, hopinge no thing therof, and youre mede schal be myche, and ye schulen be the sones of the Heyest, for he is benygne on vnkynde men and yuele men.
Therfor be ye merciful, as youre fadir is merciful.
Nyle ye deme, and ye schulen not be demed. Nyle ye condempne, and ye schulen not be condempned; foryyue ye, and it schal be foryouun to you.
Yyue ye, and it schal be youun to you. Thei schulen yyue in to youre bosum a good mesure, and wel fillid, and schakun togidir, and ouerflowynge; for bi the same mesure, bi whiche ye meeten, it schal be metun `ayen to you.
And he seide to hem a liknesse, Whether the blynde may leede the blynde? ne fallen thei not bothe `in to the diche?
A disciple is not aboue the maistir; but eche schal be perfite, if he be as his maister.
And what seest thou in thi brotheris iye a moot, but thou biholdist not a beem, that is in thin owne iye?
Or hou maist thou seie to thi brother, Brothir, suffre, Y schal caste out the moot of thin iye, and thou biholdist not a beem in thin owne iye? Ipocrite, first take out the beem of thin iye, and thanne thou schalt se to take the moot of thi brotheris iye.
It is not a good tree, that makith yuel fruytis, nether an yuel tree, that makith good fruytis;
for euery tre is knowun of his fruyt. And men gaderen not figus of thornes, nethir men gaderen a grape of a buysche of breris.
A good man of the good tresoure of his herte bryngith forth good thingis, and an yuel man of the yuel tresoure bryngith forth yuel thingis; for of the plente of the herte the mouth spekith.
And what clepen ye me, Lord, Lord, and doon not tho thingis that Y seie.
Eche that cometh to me, and herith my wordis, and doith hem, Y schal schewe to you, to whom he is lijk.
He is lijk to a man that bildith an hous, that diggide deepe, and sette the foundement on a stoon. And whanne greet flood was maad, the flood was hurtlid to that hous, and it miyte not moue it, for it was foundid on a sad stoon.
But he that herith, and doith not, is lijk to a man bildynge his hous on erthe with outen foundement; in to which the flood was hurlid, and anoon it felle doun; and the fallyng doun of that hous was maad greet.
And whanne he hadde fulfillid alle hise wordis in to the eeris of the puple, he entride in to Cafarnaum.
But a seruaunt of a centurien, that was precious to hym, was sijk, and drawynge to the deeth.
And whanne he hadde herd of Jhesu, he sente to hym the eldere men of Jewis, and preiede hym, that he wolde come, and heele his seruaunt.
And whanne thei camen to Jhesu, thei preieden hym bisili, and seiden to hym, For he is worthi, that thou graunte to hym this thing;
for he loueth oure folk, and he bildide to vs a synagoge.
And Jhesus wente with hem. And whanne he was not fer fro the hous, the centurien sente to hym freendis, and seide, Lord, nyle thou be trauelid, for Y am not worthi, that thou entre vnder my roof;
for which thing and Y demede not my silf worthi, that Y come to thee; but seie thou bi word, and my child schal be helid.
For Y am a man ordeyned vndur power, and haue knyytis vndur me; and Y seie to this, Go, and he goith, and to anothir, Come, and he cometh, and to my seruaunt, Do this thing, and he doith.
And whanne this thing was herd, Jhesus wondride; and seide to the puple suynge hym, Treuli Y seie to you, nether in Israel Y foond so greet feith.
And thei that weren sent, turneden ayen home, and founden the seruaunt hool, which was sijk.
And it was don aftirward, Jhesus wente in to a citee, that is clepid Naym, and hise disciplis; and ful greet puple wente with hym.
And whanne he cam nyy to the yate of the citee, lo! the sone of a womman that hadde no mo children, was borun out deed; and this was a widowe; and myche puple of the citee with hir.
And whanne the Lord Jhesu hadde seyn hir, he hadde reuthe on hir, and seide to hir, Nyle thou wepe.
And he cam nyy, and touchide the beere; and thei that baren stoden. And he seide, Yonge man, Y seie to thee, rise vp.
And he that was deed sat vp ayen, and bigan to speke; and he yaf hym to his modir.
And drede took alle men, and thei magnyfieden God, and seiden, For a grete profete is rysun among vs, and, For God hath visitid his puple.
And this word wente out of hym in to al Judee, and in to al the cuntre aboute.
And Joones disciplis toolden hym of alle these thingis.
And Joon clepide tweyn of hise disciplis, and sente hem to Jhesu, and seide, Art thou he that is to come, or abiden we anothir?
And whanne the men cam to hym, thei seiden, Joon Baptist sente vs to thee, and seide, Art thou he that is to come, or we abiden anothir?
And in that our he heelide many men of her sijknessis, and woundis, and yuel spiritis; and he yaf siyt to many blynde men.
And Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Go ye ayen, and telle ye to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn; blynde men seyn, crokid men goen, mesels ben maad cleene, deef men heren, deed men risen ayen, pore men ben takun to prechyng of the gospel.
And he that schal not be sclaundrid in me, is blessid.
And whanne the messangeris of Joon weren go forth, he bigan to seie of Joon to the puple,
What wenten ye out in to desert to se? a reed waggid with the wynd?
But what wenten ye out to se? a man clothid with softe clothis? Lo! thei that ben in precious cloth and in delicis, ben in kyngis housis. But what wenten ye out to se? a profete? Yhe, Y seie to you, and more than a profete.
This is he, of whom it is writun, Lo! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face, which schal make `thi weie redi bifor thee.
Certis Y seie to you, there is no man more prophete among children of wymmen, than is Joon; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes, is more than he.
And al the puple herynge, and pupplicans, that hadden be baptisid with baptym of Joon, iustifieden God;
but the Farisees and the wise men of the lawe, that weren not baptisid of hym, dispisiden the counsel of God ayens hem silf.
And the Lord seide, Therfor to whom schal Y seie `men of this generacioun lijk, and to whom ben thei lijk?
Thei ben lijk to children sittynge in chepyng, and spekynge togider, and seiynge, We han sungun to you with pipis, and ye han not daunsid; we han maad mornyng, and ye han not wept.
For Joon Baptist cam, nethir etynge breed, ne drynkynge wyne, and ye seyen, He hath a feend.
Mannus sone cam etynge and drynkynge, and ye seien, Lo! a man a deuourer, and drynkynge wyne, a frend of pupplicans and of synful men.
And wisdom is iustified of her sones.
But oon of the Farisees preiede Jhesu, that he schulde ete with hym. And he entride in to the hous of the Farise, and sat at the mete.
And lo! a synful womman, that was in the citee, as sche knewe, that Jhesu sat at the mete in the hous of the Farisee, sche brouyte an alabaustre box of oynement;
and sche stood bihynde bysidis hise feet, and bigan to moiste hise feet with teeris, and wipide with the heeris of hir heed, and kiste hise feet, and anoyntide with oynement.
And the Farise seynge, that hadde clepide hym, seide within hym silf, seiynge, If this were a prophete, he schulde wite, who and what maner womman it were that touchith hym, for sche is a synful womman.
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Symount, Y haue sumthing to seie to thee. And he seide, Maistir, seie thou.
And he answeride, Twei dettouris weren to o lener; and oon auyt fyue hundrid pans, and `the other fifti;
but whanne thei hadden not wherof `thei schulden yeelde, he foryaf to bothe. Who thanne loueth hym more?
Symount answeride, and seide, Y gesse, that he to whom he foryaf more. And he answeride to hym, Thou hast demyd riytli.
And he turnede to the womman, and seide to Symount, Seest thou this womman? I entride into thin hous, thou yaf no watir to my feet; but this hath moistid my feet with teeris, and wipide with hir heeris.
Thou hast not youun to me a cosse; but this, sithen sche entride, ceesside not to kisse my feet.
Thou anoyntidist not myn heed with oile; but this anoyntide my feet with oynement.
For the which thing Y seie to thee, many synnes ben foryouun to hir, for sche hath loued myche; and to whom is lesse foryouun, he loueth lesse.
And Jhesus seide to hir, Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee.
And thei that saten to gider at the mete, bigunnen to seie with ynne hem silf, Who is this that foryyueth synnes.
But he seide to the womman, Thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go thou in pees.
And it was don aftirward, and Jhesus made iourney bi citees and castels, prechynge and euangelisynge the rewme of God, and twelue with hym;
and sum wymmen that weren heelid of wickid spiritis and sijknessis, Marie, that is clepid Maudeleyn, of whom seuene deuelis wenten out,
and Joone, the wijf of Chuse, the procuratoure of Eroude, and Susanne, and many othir, that mynystriden to hym of her ritchesse.
And whanne myche puple was come togidir, and men hiyeden to hym fro the citees, he seide bi a symylitude,
He that sowith, yede out to sowe his seed. And while he sowith, sum fel bisidis the weie, and was defoulid, and briddis of the eir eten it.
And othir fel on a stoon, and it sprunge vp, and driede, for it hadde not moysture.
And othir fel among thornes, and the thornes sprongen vp togider, and strangliden it.
And othir fel in to good erthe, and it sprungun made an hundrid foold fruyt. He seide these thingis, and criede, He that hath eeris of heryng, here he.
But hise disciplis axiden him, what this parable was.
And he seide to hem, To you it is grauntid to knowe the pryuete of the kyngdom of God; but to othir men in parablis, that thei seynge se not, and thei herynge vndurstonde not.
And this is the parable.
The seed is Goddis word; and thei that ben bisidis the weie, ben these that heren; and aftirward the feend cometh, and takith awei the word fro her herte, lest thei bileuynge be maad saaf.
But thei that fel on a stoon, ben these that whanne thei han herd, resseyuen the word with ioye. And these han not rootis; for at a tyme thei bileuen, and in tyme of temptacioun thei goen awei.
But that that fel among thornes, ben these that herden, and of bisynessis, and ritchessis, and lustis of lijf thei gon forth, and ben stranglid, and bryngen forth no fruyt.
But that that fel in to good erthe, ben these that, in a good herte, and best heren the word, and holdun, and brengen forth fruyt in pacience.
No man lityneth a lanterne, and hilith it with a vessel, or puttith it vndur a bed, but on a candilstike, that men that entren seen liyt.
For ther is no priuei thing, which schal not be openyd, nether hid thing, which schal not be knowun, and come in to open.
Therfor se ye, hou ye heren; for it schal be youun to hym that hath, and who euer hath not, also that that he weneth that he haue, schal be takun awei fro hym.
And his modir and britheren camen to hym; and thei myyten not come to hym for the puple.
And it was teeld to hym, Thi modir and thi britheren stonden with outforth, willynge to se thee.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, My modir and my britheren ben these, that heren the word of God, and doon it.
And it was don in oon of daies, he wente vp in to a boot, and hise disciplis. And he seide to hem, Passe we ouer the see. And thei wenten vp.
And while thei rowiden, he slepte. And a tempest of wynde cam doun in to the watir, and thei weren dryuun hidur and thidur with wawis, and weren in perel.
And thei camen nyy, and reisiden hym, and seiden, Comaundoure, we perischen. And he roos, and blamyde the wynde, and the tempest of the watir; and it ceesside, and pesibilte was maad.
And he seide to hem, Where is youre feith? Which dredynge wondriden, and seiden togidir, Who, gessist thou, is this? for he comaundith to wyndis and to the see, and thei obeien to hym.
And thei rowiden to the cuntree of Gerasenus, that is ayens Galilee.
And whanne he wente out to the loond, a man ran to hym, that hadde a deuel long tyme, and he was not clothid with cloth, nether dwellide in hous, but in sepulcris.
This, whanne he saiy Jhesu, fel doun bifor hym, and he criynge with a greet vois seide, What to me and to thee, Jhesu, the sone of the hiyest God? Y biseche thee, that thou turmente `not me.
For he comaundide the vncleene spirit, that he schulde go out fro the man. For he took hym ofte tymes, and he was boundun with cheynes, and kept in stockis, and, whanne the boondis weren brokun, he was lad of deuelis in to desert.
And Jhesus axide hym, and seide, What name is to thee? And he seide, A legioun ; for many deuelis weren entrid in to hym.
And thei preyden hym, that he schulde not comaunde hem, that thei schulden go in to helle.
And there was a flok of many swyne lesewynge in an hil, and thei preieden hym, that he schulde suffre hem to entre in to hem. And he suffride hem.
And so the deuelis wenten out fro the man, and entriden in to the swyne; and with a birre the flok wente heedlyng in to the pool, and was drenchid.
And whanne the hirdis sayn this thing don, thei flowen, and tolden in to the cite, and in to the townes.
And thei yeden out to se that thing that was don. And thei camen to Jhesu, and thei founden the man sittynge clothid, fro whom the deuelis wenten out, and in hool mynde at hise feet; and thei dredden.
And thei that sayn tolden to hem, hou he was maad hool of the legioun.
And al the multitude of the cuntre of Gerasenus preiede hym, that he schulde go fro hem, for thei werun holdun with greet drede. He wente vp in to a boot, and turnede ayen.
And the man of whom the deuelis weren gon out, preide hym, that he schulde be with hym. Jhesus lefte hym,
and seide, Go ayen in to thin hous, and telle hou grete thingis God hath don to thee. And he wente thorow al the cite, and prechide, hou grete thingis Jhesus hadde don to hym.
And it was don, whanne Jhesus was gon ayen, the puple resseyuede hym; for alle weren abidynge hym.
And lo! a man, to whom the name was Jayrus, and he was prynce of a synagoge; and he fel doun at the feet of Jhesu, and preiede hym, that he schulde entre in to his hous,
for he hadde but o douyter `almost of twelue yeer eelde, and sche was deed. And it bifel, the while he wente, he was thrungun of the puple.
And a womman that hadde a flux of blood twelue yeer, and hadde spendid al hir catel in leechis, and sche miyte not be curid of ony,
and sche cam nyy bihynde, and touchide the hem of his cloth, and anoon the fluxe of hir blood ceesside.
And Jhesus seide, Who is that touchide me? And whanne alle men denyeden, Petre seide, and thei that weren with hym, Comaundour, the puple thristen, and disesen thee, and thou seist, Who touchide me?
And Jhesus seide, Summan hath touchid me, for that vertu yede out of me.
And the womman seynge, that it was not hid fro hym, cam tremblynge, and fel doun at hise feet, and for what cause sche hadde touchid hym sche schewide bifor al the puple, and hou anoon sche was helid.
And he seide to hir, Douytir, thi feith hath maad thee saaf; go thou in pees.
And yit while he spak, a man cam fro the prince of the synagoge, and seide to hym, Thi douytir is deed, nyle thou trauel the maister.
And whanne this word was herd, Jhesus answeride to the fadir of the damysel, Nyle thou drede, but bileue thou oonli, and sche schal be saaf.
And whanne he cam to the hous, he suffride no man to entre with hym, but Petir and Joon and James, and the fadir and the modir of the damysel.
And alle wepten, and biweileden hir. And he seide, Nyle ye wepe, for the damysel is not deed, but slepith.
And thei scorneden hym, and wisten that sche was deed.
But he helde hir hoond, and criede, and seide, Damysel, rise vp.
And hir spirit turnede ayen, and sche roos anoon. And he comaundide to yyue to hir to ete.
And hir fadir and modir wondriden greetli; and he comaundide hem, that thei schulden not seie to ony that thing that was don.
And whanne the twelue apostlis weren clepid togidir, Jhesus yaf to hem vertu and power on alle deuelis, and that thei schulden heele sijknessis.
And he sente hem for to preche the kyngdom of God, and to heele sijk men.
And he seide to hem, No thing take ye in the weie, nether yerde, ne scrippe, nether breed, ne money, and nether haue ye two cootis.
And in to what hous that ye entren, dwelle ye there, and go ye not out fro thennus.
And who euer resseyuen not you, go ye out of that citee, and schake ye of the poudir of youre feet in to witnessyng on hem.
And thei yeden forth, and wenten aboute bi castels, prechynge and helynge euery where.
And Eroude tetrak herde alle thingis that weren don of hym, and he doutide,
for that it was seide of sum men, that Joon was risen fro deth; and of summen, that Elie hadde apperid; but of othere, that oon of the elde prophetis was risun.
And Eroude seide, Y haue biheedid Joon; and who is this, of whom Y here siche thingis? And he souyte to se hym.
And the apostlis turneden ayen, and tolden to hym alle thingis that thei hadden don. And he took hem, and wente bisidis in to a desert place, that is Bethsada.
And whanne the puple knewen this, thei folewiden hym. And he resseyuede hem, and spak to hem of the kyngdom of God; and he heelide hem that hadden neede of cure.
And the dai bigan to bowe doun, and the twelue camen, and seiden to hym, Leeue the puple, that thei go, and turne in to castels and townes, that ben aboute, that thei fynde mete, for we ben here in a desert place.
And he seide to hem, Yue ye to hem to ete. And thei seiden, Ther ben not to vs mo than fyue looues and twei fischis, but perauenture that we go, and bie meetis to al this puple.
And the men weren almost fyue thousynde. And he seide to hise disciplis, Make ye hem sitte to mete bi cumpanyes, a fifti to gidir.
And thei diden so, and thei maden alle men sitte to mete.
And whanne he hadde take the fyue looues and twei fischis, he biheeld in to heuene, and blesside hem, and brak, and delide to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette forth bifor the cumpanyes.
And alle men eeten, and weren fulfillid; and that that lefte to hem of brokun metis was takun vp, twelue cofyns.
And it was don, whanne he was aloone preiynge, hise disciplis weren with hym, and he axide hem, and seide, Whom seien the puple that Y am?
And thei answeriden, and seiden, Joon Baptist, othir seien Elie, and othir seien, o profete of the formere is risun.
And he seide to hem, But who seien ye that Y am? Symount Petir answeride, and seide, The Crist of God.
And he blamynge hem comaundide that thei schulden seie to no man,
and seide these thingis, For it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of the elder men, and of the princis of prestis, and of scribis, and to be slayn, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
And he seide to alle, If ony wole come aftir me, denye he hym silf, and take he his cross euery dai, and sue he me.
For he that wole make his lijf saaf schal leese it; and he that leesith his lijf for me, schal make it saaf.
And what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and leese hymsilf, and do peiryng of him silf.
For who so schameth me and my wordis, mannus sone schal schame hym, whanne he cometh in his maieste, and of the fadris, and of the hooli aungels.
And Y seie to you, verily ther ben summe stondynge here, whiche schulen not taste deeth, til thei seen the rewme of God.
And it was don aftir these wordis almest eiyte daies, and he took Petre and James and Joon, and he stiede in to an hil, to preye.
And while he preiede, the licnesse of his cheer was chaungid, and his clothing was whit schynynge.
And lo! two men spaken with hym,
and Moises and Helie weren seen in maieste; and thei sayn his goyng out, which he schulde fulfille in Jerusalem.
And Petre, and thei that weren with hym, weren heuy of sleep, and thei wakynge saien his majeste, and the twey men that stoden with hym.
And it was don, whanne thei departiden fro hym, Petir seide to Jhesu, Comaundour, it is good that we be here, and make we here thre tabernaclis, oon to thee, and oon to Moises, and oon to Elie. And he wiste not what he schulde seie.
But while he spak these thingis, a cloude was maad, and ouerschadewide hem; and thei dredden, whanne thei entriden in to the cloude.
And a vois was maad out of the cloude, and seide, This is my derworth sone, here ye hym.
And while the vois was maad, Jhesu was foundun aloone. And thei weren stille, and to no man seiden in tho daies ouyt of tho thingis, that thei hadden seyn.
But it was doon in the dai suynge, whanne thei camen doun of the hil, myche puple mette hem.
And lo! a man of the cumpany criede, and seide, Maister, Y biseche thee, biholde my sone, for Y haue no mo; and lo!
a spirit takith hym, and sudenli he crieth, and hurtlith doun, and to-drawith hym with fome, and vnneth he goith awei al to-drawynge hym.
And Y preiede thi disciplis, that thei schulden caste hym out, and thei myyten not.
And Jhesus answerde and seide to hem, A! vnfeithful generacioun and weiward, hou long schal Y be at you, and suffre you? brynge hidur thi sone.
And whanne he cam nyy, the deuel hurtlide hym doun, and to-braidide hym. And Jhesus blamyde `the vnclene spirit, and heelide the child, and yeldide him to his fadir.
And alle men wondriden greetli in the gretnesse of God. And whanne alle men wondriden in alle thingis that he dide, he seide to hise disciplis,
Putte ye these wordis in youre hertis, for it is to come, that mannus sone be bitrayed in to the hondis of men.
And thei knewen not this word, and it was hid bifor hem, that thei feeliden it not; and thei dredden to axe hym of this word.
But a thouyt entride in to hem, who of hem schulde be grettest.
And Jhesu, seynge the thouytis of the herte of hem, took a child, and settide hym bisidis hym;
and seide to hem, Who euer resseyueth this child in my name, resseyueth me; and who euer resseyueth me, resseiueth him that sente me; for he that is leest among you alle, is the grettest.
And Joon answeride and seide, Comaundoure, we sayn a man castynge out feendis in thi name, and we han forbedun hym, for he sueth not thee with vs.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Nyle ye forbede, for he that is not ayens vs, is for vs.
And it was don, whanne the daies of his takyng vp weren fulfillid, he settide faste his face, to go to Jerusalem,
and sente messangeris bifor his siyt. And thei yeden, and entriden in to a citee of Samaritans, to make redi to hym.
And thei resseyueden not hym, for the face `was of hym goynge in to Jerusalem.
And whanne James and Joon, hise disciplis, seyn, thei seiden, Lord, wolt thou that we seien, that fier come doun fro heuene, and waste hem?
And he turnede, and blamyde hem, and seide, Ye witen not, whos spiritis ye ben;
for mannus sone cam not to leese mennus soulis, but to saue. And thei wenten in to another castel.
And it was don, whanne thei walkeden in the weie, a man seide to hym, Y schal sue thee, whidur euer thou go.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Foxis han dennes, and briddis of the eir han nestis, but mannus sone hath not where he reste his heed.
And he seide to another, Sue thou me. And he seide, Lord, suffre me first to go, and birie my fadir.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Suffre that deede men birie hir deede men; but go thou, and telle the kyngdom of God.
And another seide, Lord, Y schal sue thee, but first suffre me to leeue `alle thingis that ben at hoom.
And Jhesus seide to hym, No man that puttith his hoond to the plouy, and biholdynge bacward, is able to the rewme of God.
And aftir these thingis the Lord Jhesu ordeynede also othir seuenti and tweyn, and sente hem bi tweyn and tweyn bifor his face in to euery citee and place, whidir he was to come.
And he seide to hem, There is myche ripe corn, and fewe werke men; therfor preie ye the lord of the ripe corn, that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn.
Go ye, lo! Y sende you as lambren among wolues.
Therfor nyle ye bere a sachel, nethir scrippe, nethir schoon, and greete ye no man bi the weie.
In to what hous that ye entren, first seie ye, Pees to this hous.
And if a sone of pees be there, youre pees schal reste on hym; but if noon, it schal turne ayen to you.
And dwelle ye in the same hous, etynge and drynkynge tho thingis that ben at hem; for a werk man is worthi his hire. Nyle ye passe from hous in to hous.
And in to what euer citee ye entren, and thei resseyuen you, ete ye tho thingis that ben set to you;
and heele ye the sijke men that ben in that citee. And seie ye to hem, The kyngdom of God schal neiye in to you.
In to what citee ye entren, and thei resseyuen you not, go ye out in to the streetis of it,
and seie ye, We wipen of ayens you the poudir that cleued to vs of youre citee; netheles wite ye this thing, that the rewme of God schal come nyy.
Y seie to you, that to Sodom it schal be esiere than to that citee in that dai.
Wo to thee, Corosayn; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon the vertues hadden be don, whiche han be don in you, sum tyme thei wolden haue sete in heyre and asches, and haue don penaunce.
Netheles to Tire and Sidon it schal be esiere in the doom than to you.
And thou, Cafarnaum, art enhaunsid `til to heuene; thou schalt be drenchid `til in to helle.
He that herith you, herith me; and he that dispisith you, dispisith me; and he that dispisith me, dispisith hym that sente me.
And the two and seuenti disciplis turneden ayen with ioye, and seiden, Lord, also deuelis ben suget to vs in thi name.
And he seide to hem, Y saiy Sathnas fallynge doun fro heuene, as leit.
And lo! Y haue youun to you power to trede on serpentis, and on scorpyouns, and on al the vertu of the enemy, and nothing schal anoye you.
Netheles nyle ye ioye on this thing, that spiritis ben suget to you; but ioye ye, that youre names ben writun in heuenes.
In thilk our he gladide in the Hooli Goost, and seide, Y knouleche to thee, fadir, Lord of heuene and of erthe, for thou hast hid these thingis fro wise men and prudent, and hast schewid hem to smale children. Yhe, fadir, for so it pleside bifor thee.
Alle thingis ben youun to me of my fadir, and no man woot, who is the sone, but the fadir; and who is the fadir, but the sone, and to whom the sone wole schewe.
And he turnede to hise disciplis, and seide, Blessid ben the iyen, that seen tho thingis that ye seen.
For Y seie to you, that many prophetis and kyngis wolden haue seie tho thingis, that ye seen, and thei sayn not; and here tho thingis, that ye heren, and thei herden not.
And lo! a wise man of the lawe ros vp, temptynge hym, and seiynge, Maister, what thing schal Y do to haue euerlastynge lijf?
And he seide to hym, What is writun in the lawe? hou redist thou?
He answeride, and seide, Thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of alle thi strengthis, and of al thi mynde; and thi neiybore as thi silf.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Thou hast answerid riytli; do this thing, and thou schalt lyue.
But he willynge to iustifie hym silf, seide to Jhesu, And who is my neiybore?
And Jhesu biheld, and seide, A man cam doun fro Jerusalem in to Jerico, and fel among theues, and thei robbiden hym, and woundiden hym, and wente awei, and leften the man half alyue.
And it bifel, that a prest cam doun the same weie, and passide forth, whanne he hadde seyn hym.
Also a dekene, whanne he was bisidis the place, and saiy him, passide forth.
But a Samaritan, goynge the weie, cam bisidis hym; and he siy hym, and hadde reuthe on hym;
and cam to hym, and boond togidir hise woundis, and helde in oyle and wynne; and leide hym on his beest, and ledde in to an ostrie, and dide the cure of hym.
And another dai he brouyte forth twey pans, and yaf to the ostiler, and seide, Haue the cure of hym; and what euer thou schalt yyue ouer, Y schal yelde to thee, whanne Y come ayen.
Who of these thre, semeth to thee, was neiybore to hym, that fel among theues?
And he seide, He that dide merci in to hym. And Jhesus seide to hym, Go thou, and do thou on lijk maner.
And it was don, while thei wenten, he entride in to a castel; and a womman, Martha bi name, resseyuede hym in to hir hous.
And to this was a sistir, Marie bi name, which also sat bisidis the feet of the Lord, and herde his word.
But Martha bisiede aboute the ofte seruyce. And sche stood, and seide, Lord, takist thou no kepe, that my sistir hath left me aloone to serue? therfor seie thou to hir, that sche helpe me.
And the Lord answerde, and seide to hir, Martha, Martha, thou art bysi, and art troublid aboute ful many thingis;
but o thing is necessarie. Marie hath chosun the best part, which schal not be takun awei fro hir.
And it was don, whanne he was preiynge in a place, as he ceesside, oon of hise disciplis seide to hym, Lord, teche vs to preye, as Joon tauyte hise disciplis.
And he seide to hem, Whanne ye preien, seie ye, Fadir, halewid be thi name. Thi kyngdom come to.
Yyue `to vs to dai oure ech daies breed.
And foryyue to vs oure synnes, as we foryyuen to ech man that owith to vs. And lede vs not in to temptacioun.
And he seide to hem, Who of you schal haue a freend, and schal go to hym at mydnyyt, and schal seie to hym, Freend, leene to me thre looues;
for my freend cometh to me fro the weie, and Y haue not what Y schal sette bifor hym.
And he with ynforth answere and seie, Nyle thou be heuy to me; the dore is now schit, and my children ben with me in bed; Y may not rise, and yyue to thee.
And if he schal dwelle stil knockynge, Y seie to you, thouy he schal not rise, and yyue to him, for that that he is his freend, netheles for his contynuel axyng he schal ryse, and yyue to hym, as many as he hath nede to.
And Y seie to you, axe ye, and it schal be youun to you; seke ye, and ye schulen fynde; knocke ye, and it schal be openyd to you.
For ech that axith, takith, and he that sekith, fyndith; and to a man that knockith, it schal be openyd.
Therfor who of you axith his fadir breed, whether he schal yyue hym a stoon? or if he axith fisch, whether he schal yyue hym a serpent for the fisch?
or if he axe an eye, whether he schal a reche hym a scorpioun?
Therfor if ye, whanne ye ben yuel, kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre children, hou myche more youre fadir of heuene schal yyue a good spirit to men that axith him.
And Jhesus was castynge out a feend, and he was doumbe. And whanne he hadde cast out the feend, the doumbe man spak; and the puple wondride.
And sum of hem seiden, In Belsabub, prince of deuelis, he castith out deuelis.
And othir temptinge axiden of hym a tokene fro heuene.
And as he saiy the thouytis of hem, he seide to hem, Euery rewme departid ayens it silf, schal be desolat, and an hous schal falle on an hous.
And if Sathanas be departid ayens hym silf, hou schal his rewme stonde? For ye seien, that Y caste out feendis in Belsabub.
And if Y in Belsabub caste out fendis, in whom casten out youre sones? Therfor thei schulen be youre domesmen.
But if Y caste out fendis in the fyngir of God, thanne the rewme of God is comun among you.
Whanne a strong armed man kepith his hous, alle thingis that he weldith ben in pees.
But if a stronger than he come vpon hym, and ouercome hym, he schal take awei al his armere, in which he tristide, and schal dele abrood his robries.
He that is not with me, is ayens me; and he that gederith not togidir with me, scaterith abrood.
Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out of a man, he wandrith bi drie placis, and sekith reste; and he fyndynge not, seith, Y schal turne ayen in to myn hous, fro whannes Y cam out.
And whanne he cometh, he fyndith it clansid with besyms, and fayre arayed.
Thanne he goith, and takith with hym seuene othere spirits worse than hym silf, and thei entren, and dwellen there. And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere.
And it was don, whanne he hadde seid these thingis, a womman of the cumpanye reride hir vois, and seide to hym, Blessid be the wombe that bare thee, and blessid be the tetis that thou hast soken.
And he seide, But yhe blessid be thei, that heren the word of God, and kepen it.
And whanne the puple runnen togidere, he bigan to seie, This generacioun is a weiward generacioun; it sekith a token, and a tokene schal not be youun to it, but the tokene of Jonas, the profete.
For as Jonas was a tokene to men of Nynyue, so mannus sone schal be to this generacioun.
The queen of the south schal rise in doom with men of this generacioun, and schal condempne hem; for sche cam fro the endis of the erthe, for to here the wisdom of Salomon, and lo! here is a gretter than Salomon.
Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun, and schulen condempne it; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas, and lo! here is a gretter than Jonas.
No man tendith a lanterne, and puttith in hidils, nether vndur a buyschel, but on a candilstike, that thei that goen in, se liyt.
The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye; if thin iye be symple, al thi bodi schal be liyti; but if it be weyward, al thi bodi schal be derkful.
Therfor se thou, lest the liyt that is in thee, be derknessis.
Therfor if al thi bodi be briyt, and haue no part of derknessis, it schal be al briyt, and as a lanterne of briytnesse it schal yyue liyt to thee.
And whanne he spak, a Farisee preiede him, that he schulde ete with hym. And he entride, and sat to the meete.
And the Farisee bigan to seie, gessynge with ynne hym silf, whi he was not waschen bifor mete.
And the Lord seide to hym, Now ye Farisees clensen that that is with outenforth of the cuppe and the plater; but that thing that is with ynne of you, is ful of raueyn and wickidnesse.
Foolis, whether he that made that that is withoutenforth, made not also that that is with ynne?
Netheles that that is ouer plus, yyue ye almes, and lo! alle thingis ben cleene to you.
But wo to you, Farisees, that tithen mynte, and rue, and ech eerbe, and leeuen doom and the charite of God. For it bihofte to do these thingis, and not leeue tho.
Wo to you, Farisees, that louen the firste chaieris in synagogis, and salutaciouns in chepyng.
Wo to you, that ben as sepulcris, that ben not seyn, and men walkynge aboue witen not.
But oon of the wise men of the lawe answeride, and seide to hym, Maystir, thou seiynge these thingis, also to vs doist dispit.
And he seide, Also wo to you, wise men of lawe, for ye chargen men with birthuns which thei moun not bere, and ye you silf with youre o fyngur touchen not the heuynessis.
Wo to you, that bilden toumbis of profetis; and youre fadris slowen hem.
Treuli ye witnessen, that ye consenten to the werkis of youre fadris; for thei slowen hem, but ye bilden her sepulcris.
Therfor the wisdom of God seide, Y schal sende to hem profetis and apostlis, and of hem thei schulen sle and pursue,
that the blood of alle prophetis, that was sched fro the making of the world, be souyt of this generacioun;
fro the blood of the iust Abel to the blood of Zacharie, that was slayn bitwixe the auter and the hous. So Y seie to you, it schal be souyt of this generacioun.
Wo to you, wise men of the lawe, for ye han takun awei the keye of kunnyng; and ye yow silf entriden not, and ye han forbeden hem that entriden.
And whanne he seide these thingis to hem, the Farisees and wise men of lawe bigunnen greuousli to ayenstonde, and stoppe his mouth of many thingis,
aspiynge hym, and sekynge to take sum thing of his mouth, to accuse hym.
And whanne myche puple stood aboute, so that thei treden ech on othir, he bigan to seie to hise disciplis, Be ye war of the sourdouy of the Farisees, that is ypocrisie.
For no thing is hilid, that schal not be schewid; nether hid, that schal not be wist.
For whi tho thingis that ye han seid in derknessis, schulen be seid in liyt; and that that ye han spokun in eere in the couchis, schal be prechid in roofes.
And Y seie to you, my freendis, be ye not a ferd of hem that sleen the bodie, and aftir these thingis han no more what thei schulen do.
But Y schal schewe to you, whom ye schulen drede; drede ye hym, that aftir he hath slayn, he hath power to sende in to helle. And so Y seie to you, drede ye hym.
Whether fyue sparowis ben not seld for twei halpens; and oon of hem is not in foryetyng bifor God?
But also alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid. Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben of more prijs than many sparowis.
Treuli Y seie to you, ech man that knoulechith me bifor men, mannus sone schal knouleche hym bifor the aungels of God.
But he that denyeth me bifor men, schal be denyed bifor the aungels of God.
And ech that seith a word ayens mannus sone, it schal be foryouun to hym; but it schal not be foryouun to hym, that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost.
And whanne thei leden you in to synagogis, and to magistratis, and potestatis, nyle ye `be bisie, hou or what ye schulen answere, or what ye schulen seie.
For the Hooli Goost schal teche you in that our, what it bihoueth you to seie.
And oon of the puple seide to hym, Maystir, seie to my brothir, that he departe with me the eritage.
And he seyde to hym, Man, who ordeynede me a domesman, or a departere, on you?
And he seide to hem, Se ye, and be ye war of al coueytice; for the lijf of a man is not in the abundaunce of tho thingis, whiche he weldith.
And he tolde to hem a liknesse, and seide, The feeld of a riche man brouyte forth plenteuouse fruytis.
And he thouyte with ynne hym silf, and seide, What schal Y do, for Y haue not whidur Y schal gadere my fruytis?
And he seith, This thing Y schal do; Y schal throwe doun my bernes, and Y schal make gretter, and thidir Y schal gadir alle thingis that growen to me, and my goodis.
And Y schal seie to my soule, Soule, thou hast many goodis kept in to ful many yeeris; rest thou, ete, drynke, and make feeste.
And God seide to hym, Fool, in this nyyt thei schulen take thi lijf fro thee. And whos schulen tho thingis be, that thou hast arayed?
So is he that tresourith to hym silf, and is not riche in God.
And he seide to hise disciplis, Therfor Y seie to you, nyle ye be bisy to youre lijf, what ye schulen ete, nether to youre bodi, with what ye schulen be clothid.
The lijf is more than mete, and the body more than clothing.
Biholde ye crowis, for thei sowen not, nethir repen, to whiche is no celer, ne berne, and God fedith hem. Hou myche more ye ben of more prijs than thei.
And who of you bithenkynge may put to o cubit to his stature?
Therfor if ye moun not that that is leest, what ben ye bisie of othere thingis?
Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld, hou thei wexen; thei trauelen not, nethir spynnen. And Y seie to you, that nethir Salomon in al his glorie was clothid as oon of these.
And if God clothith thus the hey, that to dai is in the feeld, and to morewe is cast in to an ouen; hou myche more you of litil feith.
And nyle ye seke, what ye schulen ete, or what ye schulen drynke; and nyle ye be reisid an hiy.
For folkis of the world seken alle these thingis; `and your fadir woot, that ye neden alle these thingis.
Netheles seke ye first the kyngdom of God, and alle these thingis schulen be caste to you.
Nile ye, litil flok, drede, for it pleside to youre fadir to yyue you a kyngdom.
Selle ye tho thingis that ye han in possessioun, and yyue ye almes. And make to you sachels that wexen not oolde, tresoure that failith not in heuenes, whidir a theef neiyith not, nether mouyt destruyeth.
For where is thi tresoure, there thin herte schal be.
Be youre leendis gird aboue, and lanternes brennynge in youre hoondis;
and be ye lijk to men that abiden her lord, whanne he schal turne ayen fro the weddyngis, that whanne he schal come, and knocke, anoon thei openen to hym.
Blessid be tho seruauntis, that whanne the lord schal come, he schal fynde wakynge. Treuli Y seie to you, that he schal girde hym silf, and make hem sitte to mete, and he schal go, and serue hem.
And if he come in the secounde wakynge, and if he come in the thridde wakynge, and fynde so, tho seruauntis ben blessid.
And wite ye this thing, for if an hosebonde man wiste, in what our the theef wolde come, sotheli he schulde wake, and not suffre his hous to be myned.
And be ye redi, for in what our ye gessen not, mannus sone schal come.
And Petre seide to hym, Lord, seist thou this parable to vs, or to alle?
And the Lord seide, Who, gessist thou, is a trewe dispendere, and a prudent, whom the lord hath ordeyned on his meyne, to yyue hem in tyme mesure of whete?
Blessid is that seruaunt, that the lord whanne he cometh, schal fynde so doynge.
Verili Y seie to you, that on alle thingis that he weldith, he schal ordeyne hym.
That if that seruaunt seie in his herte, My lord tarieth to come; and bigynne to smyte children, and handmaydenes, and ete, and drynke, and be fulfillid ouer mesure,
the lord of that seruaunt schal come, in the dai that he hopith not, and the our that he woot not; and schal departe hym, and putte his part with vnfeithful men.
But thilke seruaunt that knew the wille of his lord, and made not hym redi, and dide not aftir his wille, schal be betun with many betyngis.
But he that knew not, and dide worthi thingis of strokis, schal be betun with fewe. For to eche man to whom myche is youun, myche schal be axid of hym; and thei schulen axe more of hym, to whom thei bitoken myche.
Y cam to sende fier `in to the erthe, and what wole Y, but that it be kyndlid?
And Y haue to be baptisid with a baptysm, and hou am Y constreyned, til that it be perfitli don?
Wene ye, that Y cam to yyue pees in to erthe? Nay, Y say to you, but departyng.
For fro this tyme ther schulen be fyue departid in oon hous; thre schulen be departid ayens tweyne, and tweyne schulen be departid ayens thre;
the fadir ayens the sone, and the sone ayens the fadir; the modir ayens the douytir, and the douytir ayens the modir; the hosebondis modir ayens the sones wijf, and and the sones wijf ayens hir hosebondis modir.
And he seide also to the puple, Whanne ye seen a cloude risynge fro the sunne goynge doun, anoon ye seien, Reyn cometh; and so it is don.
And whanne ye seen the south blowynge, ye seien, That heete schal be; and it is don.
Ypocritis, ye kunnen preue the face of heuene and of erthe, but hou preuen ye not this tyme.
But what and of you silf ye demen not that that is iust?
But whanne thou goist with thin aduersarie in the weie to the prince, do bisynesse to be delyuerid fro hym; lest perauenture he take thee to the domesman, and the domesman bitake thee to the maistirful axer, and the maistirful axer sende thee in to prisoun.
Y seie to thee, thou schalt not go fro thennus, til thou yelde the laste ferthing.
And sum men weren present in that tyme, that telden to hym of the Galileis, whos blood Pilat myngide with the sacrificis of hem.
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Wenen ye, that these men of Galile weren synneris more than alle Galilees, for thei suffriden siche thingis?
Y seie to you, nay; alle ye schulen perische in lijk manere, but ye han penaunce.
And as tho eiytetene, on which the toure in Siloa fel doun, and slowe hem, gessen ye, for thei weren dettouris more than alle men that dwellen in Jerusalem?
Y seie to you, nai; but also `ye alle schulen perische, if ye doon not penaunce.
And he seide this liknesse, A man hadde a fige tre plauntid in his vynyerd, and he cam sekynge fruyt in it, and foond noon.
And he seide to the tilier of the vynyerd, Lo! thre yeeris ben, sithen Y come sekynge fruyt in this fige tre, and Y fynde noon; therfor kitte it doun, whereto ocupieth it the erthe?
And he answerynge seide to hym, Lord, suffre it also this yeer, the while Y delue aboute it, and Y schal donge it;
if it schal make fruyt, if nay, in tyme comynge thou schalt kitte it doun.
And he was techinge in her synagoge in the sabatis.
And lo! a womman, that hadde a spirit of sijknesse eiytene yeeris, and was crokid, and `nethir ony maner myyte loke vpward.
Whom whanne Jhesus hadde seyn, he clepide to hym, and seide to hir, Womman, thou art delyuerid of thi sijknesse.
And he settide on hir his hoondis, and anoon sche stood upriyt, and glorifiede God.
And the prince of the synagoge answerde, hauynge dedeyn for Jhesus hadde heelid in the sabat; and he seide to the puple, Ther ben sixe dayes, in whiche it bihoueth to worche; therfor come ye in these, and `be ye heelid, and not in the daie of sabat.
But the Lord answeride to hym, and seide, Ypocrite, whether ech of you vntieth not in the sabat his oxe, or asse, fro the cratche, and ledith to watir?
Bihofte it not this douytir of Abraham, whom Satanas hath boundun, lo! eiytetene yeeris, to be vnboundun of this boond in the dai of the sabat?
And whanne he seide these thingis, alle hise aduersaries weren aschamed, and al the puple ioiede in alle thingis, that weren gloriousli don of hym.
Therfor he seide, To what thing is the kyngdom of God lijk? and to what thing schal Y gesse it to be lijk?
It is lijk to a corn of seneuey, which a man took, and cast in to his yerd; and it wax, and was maad in to a greet tree, and foulis of the eire restiden in the braunchis therof.
And eft soone he seide, To what thing schal Y gesse the kyngdom of God lijk?
It is lijk to sourdouy, that a womman took, and hidde it `in to thre mesuris of mele, til al were sourid.
And he wente bi citees and castels, techynge and makynge a iourney in to Jerusalem.
And a man seide to hym, Lord, if there ben fewe, that ben saued? And he seide to hem,
Stryue ye to entre bi the streite yate; for Y seie to you, many seken to entre, and thei schulen not mowe.
For whanne the hosebonde man is entrid, and the dore is closid, ye schulen bigynne to stonde with out forth, and knocke at the dore, and seie, Lord, opyn to vs. And he schal answere, and seie to you, Y knowe you not, of whennus ye ben.
Thanne ye schulen bigynne to seye, We han etun bifor thee and drunkun, and in oure streetis thou hast tauyt.
And he schal seie to you, Y know you not, of whennus ye ben; go awei fro me, alle ye worcheris of wickidnesse.
There schal be wepyng and gruntyng of teeth, whanne ye schulen se Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and alle the prophetis in the kyngdom of God; and you to be put out.
And thei schulen come fro the eest and west, and fro the north and south, and schulen sitte `at the mete in the rewme of God.
And lo! thei that weren the firste, ben the laste; and thei that weren the laste, ben the firste.
In that day sum of the Farisees camen nyy, and seiden to hym, Go out, and go fro hennus, for Eroude wole sle thee.
And he seide to hem, Go ye, and seie to that foxe, Lo! Y caste out feendis, and Y make perfitli heelthis, to dai and to morew, and the thridde dai Y am endid.
Netheles it bihoueth me to dai, and to morewe, and the dai that sueth, to walke; for it fallith not a profete to perische out of Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that sleest profetis, and stonest hem that ben sent to thee, hou ofte wolde Y gadre togider thi sones, as a brid gaderith his nest vndur fethris, and thou woldist not.
Lo! youre hous schal be left to you desert. And Y seie to you, that ye schulen not se me, til it come, whanne ye schulen seie, Blessid is he, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
And it was don, whanne he hadde entrid in to the hous of a prince of Farisees, in the sabat, to ete breed, thei aspieden hym.
And lo! a man sijk in the dropesie was bifor hym.
And Jhesus answerynge spak to the wise men of lawe, and to the Farisees, and seide, Whethir it is leeueful to heele in the sabat?
And thei helden pees. And Jhesus took, and heelide hym, and let hym go.
And he answeride to hem, and seide, Whos asse or oxe of you schal falle in to a pit, and `he schal not anoon drawe hym out in the dai of the sabat?
And thei myyten not answere to hym to these thingis.
He seide also a parable to men bodun to a feeste, and biheld hou thei chesen the first sittyng placis, and seide to hem,
Whanne thou art bodun to bridalis, sitte not `at the mete in the firste place; lest perauenture a worthier than thou be bodun of hym,
and lest he come that clepide thee and hym, and seie to thee, Yyue place to this, and thanne thou schalt bigynne with schame to holde the lowest place.
But whanne thou art bedun to a feste, go, and sitte doun in the laste place, that whanne he cometh, that bad thee to the feeste, he seie to thee, Freend, come hiyer. Thanne worschip schal be to thee, bifor men that sitten at the mete.
For ech that enhaunsith hym, schal be lowid; and he that meketh hym, schal be hiyed.
And he seide to hym, that hadde bodun hym to the feeste, Whanne thou makist a mete, or a soper, nyle thou clepe thi freendis, nether thi britheren, nethir cosyns, nethir neiyboris, ne riche men; lest perauenture thei bidde thee ayen to the feeste, and it be yolde ayen to thee.
But whanne thou makist a feeste, clepe pore men,
feble, crokid, and blynde, and thou schalt be blessid; for thei han not wherof to yelde thee, for it schal be yoldun to thee in the risyng ayen of iust men.
And whanne oon of hem that saten togider at the mete hadde herd these thingis, he seide to hym, Blessid is he, that schal ete breed in the rewme of God.
And he seide to hym, A man made a greet soper, and clepide many.
And he sent his seruaunt in the our of soper, to seie to men that weren bodun to the feeste, that thei schulden come, for now alle thingis ben redi.
And alle bigunnen togidir to excusen hem. The firste seide, Y haue bouyt a toun, and Y haue nede to go out, and se it; Y preye thee, haue me excusid.
And the tother seide, Y haue bouyt fyue yockis of oxun, and Y go to preue hem; Y preye thee, haue me excusid.
And an othir seide, Y haue weddid a wijf; and therfor Y may not come.
And the seruaunt turnede ayen, and tolde these thingis to his lord. Thanne the hosebonde man was wrooth, and seide to his seruaunt, Go out swithe in to the grete stretis and smal stretis of the citee, and brynge ynne hidir pore men, and feble, blynde, and crokid.
And the seruaunt seide, Lord, it is don, as thou hast comaundid, and yit there is a void place.
And the lord seide to the seruaunt, Go out in to weies and heggis, and constreine men to entre, that myn hous be fulfillid.
For Y seie to you, that noon of tho men that ben clepid, schal taaste my soper.
And myche puple wenten with hym; and he turnede, and seide to hem,
If ony man cometh to me, and hatith not his fadir, and modir, and wijf, and sones, and britheren, and sistris, and yit his owne lijf, he may not be my disciple.
And he that berith not his cross, and cometh aftir me, may not be my disciple.
For who of you willynge to bilde a toure, whether he `first sitte not, and countith the spensis that ben nedeful, if he haue to perfourme?
Lest aftir that he hath set the foundement, and mowe not perfourme, alle that seen, bigynnen to scorne hym, and seie, For this man bigan to bilde,
and myyte not make an ende.
Or what kyng that wole go to do a bataile ayens anothir kyng, whether he sittith not first, and bithenkith, if he may with ten thousynde go ayens hym that cometh ayens hym with twenti thousynde?
Ellis yit while he is afer, he sendynge a messanger, preieth tho thingis that ben of pees.
So therfor ech of you, that forsakith not alle thingis that he hath, may not be my disciple.
Salt is good; but if salt vanysche, in what thing schal it be sauerid?
Nethir in erthe, nethir in donghille it is profitable, but it schal be cast out. He that hath eeris of herynge, here he.
And pupplicans and synful men weren neiyynge to him, to here hym.
And the Farisees and scribis grutchiden, seiynge, For this resseyueth synful men, and etith with hem.
And he spak to hem this parable,
and seide, What man of you that hath an hundrith scheep, and if he hath lost oon of hem, whethir he leeueth not nynti and nyne in desert, and goith to it that perischide, til he fynde it?
And whanne he hath foundun it, he ioieth, and leyith it on hise schuldris; and he cometh hoom,
and clepith togidir hise freendis and neiyboris, and seith to hem, Be ye glad with me, for Y haue founde my scheep, that hadde perischid.
And Y seie to you, so ioye schal be in heuene on o synful man doynge penaunce, more than on nynti and nyne iuste, that han no nede to penaunce.
Or what womman hauynge ten besauntis, and if sche hath lost oo besaunt, whether sche teendith not a lanterne, and turneth vpsodoun the hows, and sekith diligentli, til that sche fynde it?
And whanne sche hath foundun, sche clepith togidir freendis and neiyboris, and seith, Be ye glad with me, for Y haue founde the besaunt, that Y hadde lost.
So Y seie to you, ioye schal be bifor aungels of God on o synful man doynge penaunce.
And he seide, A man hadde twei sones;
and the yonger of hem seide to the fadir, Fadir, yyue me the porcioun of catel, that fallith to me. And he departide to hem the catel.
And not aftir many daies, whanne alle thingis weren gederid togider, the yonger sone wente forth in pilgrymage in to a fer cuntre; and there he wastide hise goodis in lyuynge lecherously.
And aftir that he hadde endid alle thingis, a strong hungre was maad in that cuntre, and he bigan to haue nede.
And he wente, and drouy hym to oon of the citeseyns of that cuntre. And he sente hym in to his toun, to fede swyn.
And he coueitide to fille his wombe of the coddis that the hoggis eeten, and no man yaf hym.
And he turnede ayen to hym silf, and seide, Hou many hirid men in my fadir hous han plente of looues; and Y perische here thorouy hungir.
Y schal rise vp, and go to my fadir, and Y schal seie to hym, Fadir, Y haue synned in to heuene, and bifor thee;
and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone, make me as oon of thin hirid men.
And he roos vp, and cam to his fadir. And whanne he was yit afer, his fadir saiy hym, and was stirrid bi mercy. And he ran, and fel on his necke, and kisside hym.
And the sone seide to hym, Fadir, Y haue synned in to heuene, and bifor thee; and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone.
And the fadir seide to hise seruauntis, Swithe brynge ye forth the firste stoole, and clothe ye hym, and yyue ye a ryng in his hoond,
and schoon on hise feet; and brynge ye a fat calf, and sle ye, and ete we, and make we feeste.
For this my sone was deed, and hath lyued ayen; he perischid, and is foundun. And alle men bigunnen to ete.
But his eldere sone was in the feeld; and whanne he cam, and neiyede to the hous, he herde a symfonye and a croude.
And he clepide oon of the seruauntis, and axide, what these thingis weren.
And he seide to hym, Thi brother is comun, and thi fadir slewe a fat calf, for he resseyuede hym saaf.
And he was wrooth, and wolde not come in. Therfor his fadir wente out, and bigan to preye hym.
And he answerde to his fadir, and seide, Lo! so many yeeris Y serue thee, and Y neuer brak thi comaundement; and thou neuer yaf to me a kidde, that Y with my freendis schulde haue ete.
But aftir that this thi sone, that hath deuourid his substaunce with horis, cam, thou hast slayn to hym a fat calf.
And he seide to hym, Sone, thou art euer more with me, and alle my thingis ben thine.
But it bihofte for to make feeste, and to haue ioye; for this thi brother was deed, and lyuede ayen; he perischide, and is foundun.
He seide also to hise disciplis, Ther was a riche man, that hadde a baili; and this was defamed to him, as he hadde wastid his goodis.
And he clepide hym, and seide to hym, What here Y this thing of thee? yelde reckynyng of thi baili, for thou miyte not now be baili.
And the baili seide with ynne him silf, What schal Y do, for my lord takith awei fro me the baili? delfe mai Y not, I schame to begge.
Y woot what Y schal do, that whanne Y am remeued fro the baili, thei resseyue me in to her hous.
Therfor whanne alle the dettours of his lord weren clepid togider, he seide to the firste, Hou myche owist thou to my lord?
And he seide, An hundrid barelis of oyle. And he seide to hym, Take thi caucioun, and sitte soone, and write fifti.
Aftirward he seide to another, And hou myche owist thou? Which answerde, An hundrid coris of whete. And he seide to hym, Take thi lettris, and write foure scoore.
And the lord preiside the baili of wickydnesse, for he hadde do prudentli; for the sones of this world ben more prudent in her generacioun than the sones of liyt.
And Y seie to you, make ye to you freendis of the ritchesse of wickidnesse, that whanne ye schulen fayle, thei resseyue you in to euerlastynge tabernaclis.
He that is trewe in the leeste thing, is trewe also in the more; and he that is wickid in a litil thing, is wickid also in the more.
Therfor if ye weren not trewe in the wickid thing of ritchesse, who schal bitake to you that that is verry?
And if ye weren not trewe in othere mennus thing, who schal yyue to you that that is youre?
No seruaunt may serue to twei lordis; for ether he schal hate `the toon, and loue the tothir; ethir he schal drawe to `the toon, and schal dispise the tothir. Ye moun not serue to God and to ritchesse.
But the Farisees, that weren coueytous, herden alle these thingis, and thei scorneden hym.
And he seide to hem, Ye it ben, that iustifien you bifor men; but God hath knowun youre hertis, for that that is hiy to men, is abhomynacioun bifor God.
The lawe and prophetis til to Joon; fro that tyme the rewme of God is euangelisid, and ech man doith violence in to it.
Forsothe it is liyter heuene and erthe to passe, than that o titil falle fro the lawe.
Euery man that forsakith his wijf, and weddith an other, doith letcherie; and he that weddith the wijf forsakun of the hosebonde, doith auowtrie.
There was a riche man, and was clothid in purpur, and whit silk, and eete euery dai schynyngli.
And there was a begger, Lazarus bi name, that lai at his yate ful of bilis,
and coueitide to be fulfillid of the crummes, that fellen doun fro the riche mannus boord, and no man yaf to hym; but houndis camen, and lickiden hise bilis.
And it was don, that the begger diede, and was borun of aungels in to Abrahams bosum.
And the riche man was deed also, and was biried in helle. And he reiside hise iyen, whanne he was in turmentis, and say Abraham afer, and Lazarus in his bosum.
And he criede, and seide, Fadir Abraham, haue merci on me, and sende Lazarus, that he dippe the ende of his fyngur in watir, to kele my tunge; for Y am turmentid in this flawme.
And Abraham seide to hym, Sone, haue mynde, for thou hast resseyued good thingis in thi lijf, and Lazarus also yuel thingis; but he is now coumfortid, and thou art turmentid.
And in alle these thingis a greet derk place is stablischid betwixe vs and you; that thei that wolen fro hennus passe to you, moun not, nethir fro thennus passe ouer hidur.
And he seide, Thanne Y preie thee, fadir, that thou sende hym in to the hous of my fadir.
For Y haue fyue britheren, that he witnesse to hem, lest also thei come in to this place of turmentis.
And Abraham seide to him, Thei han Moyses and the prophetis; here thei hem.
And he seide, Nay, fadir Abraham, but if ony of deed men go to hem, thei schulen do penaunce.
And he seide to hym, If thei heren not Moises and prophetis, nethir if ony of deed men rise ayen, thei schulen bileue to hym.
And Jhesu seide to hise disciplis, It is impossible that sclaundris come not; but wo to that man, bi whom thei comen.
It is more profitable to him, if a mylne stoon be put aboute his necke, and he be cast in to the see, than that he sclaundre oon of these litle.
Take ye hede you silf; if thi brothir hath synned ayens thee, blame hym; and if he do penaunce, foryyue hym.
And if seuene sithis in the dai he do synne ayens thee, and seuene sithis in the dai he be conuertid to thee, and seie, It forthenkith me, foryyue thou hym.
And the apostlis seiden to the Lord, Encrese to vs feith.
And the Lord seide, If ye han feith as the corn of seneuei, ye schulen seie to this more tre, Be thou drawun vp bi the rote, and be ouerplauntid in to the see, and it schal obeie to you.
But who of you hath a seruaunt erynge, or lesewynge oxis, which seith to hym, whanne he turneth ayen fro the feeld, Anoon go, and sitte to mete;
and seith not to hym, Make redi, that Y soupe, and girde thee, and serue me, while Y ete and drynke, and aftir this thou schalt ete and drynke;
whether he hath grace to that seruaunt, for he dide that that he comaundide hym?
Nay, Y gesse. So ye, whanne ye han don alle thingis that ben comaundid to you, seie ye, We ben vnprofitable seruauntis, we han do that that we ouyten to do.
And it was do, the while Jhesus wente in to Jerusalem, he passide thorou the myddis of Samarie, and Galilee.
And whanne he entride in to a castel, ten leprouse men camen ayens hym, whiche stoden afer,
and reiseden her voys, and seiden, Jhesu, comaundoure, haue merci on vs.
And as he say hem, he seide, Go ye, `schewe ye you to the prestis. And it was don, the while thei wenten, thei weren clensid.
And oon of hem, as he saiy that he was clensid, wente ayen, magnifiynge God with grete vois.
And he fel doun on the face bifore hise feet, and dide thankyngis; and this was a Samaritan.
And Jhesus answerde, and seide, Whether ten ben not clensid, and where ben the nyne?
There is noon foundun, that turnede ayen, and yaf glorie to God, but this alien.
And he seide to hym, Rise vp, go thou; for thi feith hath maad thee saaf.
And he was axid of Farisees, whanne the rewme of God cometh. And he answerde to hem, and seide, The rewme of God cometh not with aspiyng,
nether thei schulen seie, Lo! here, or lo there; for lo! the rewme of God is with ynne you.
And he seide to hise disciplis, Daies schulen come, whanne ye schulen desire to se o dai of mannus sone, and ye schulen not se.
And thei schulen seie to you, Lo! here, and lo there. Nyle ye go, nether sue ye;
for as leyt schynynge from vndur heuene schyneth in to tho thingis that ben vndur heuene, so schal mannus sone be in his dai.
But first it bihoueth hym to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of this generacioun.
And as it was doon in the daies of Noe, so it schal be in the daies of mannys sone.
Thei eeten and drunkun, weddiden wyues, and weren youun to weddyngis, til in to the dai in the whych Noe entride in to the schip; and the greet flood cam, and loste alle.
Also as it was don in the daies of Loth, thei eeten and drunkun, bouyten and seelden, plauntiden and bildiden; but the dai that Loth wente out of Sodome,
the Lord reynede fier and brymstoon fro heuene, and loste alle.
Lijk this thing it schal be, in what dai mannys sone schal be schewid.
In that our he that is in the roof, and his vessels in the hous, come he not doun to take hem awei; and he that schal be in the feeld, also turne not ayen bihynde.
Be ye myndeful of the wijf of Loth.
Who euer seketh to make his lijf saaf, schal leese it; and who euer leesith it, schal quykene it.
But Y seie to you, in that nyyt twei schulen be in o bed, oon schal be takun, and the tothir forsakun;
twei wymmen schulen be gryndynge togidir, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother forsakun; twei in a feeld, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother left.
Thei answeren, and seien to hym, Where, Lord?
Which seide to hym, Where euer the bodi schal be, thidur schulen be gaderid togidere also the eglis.
And he seide to hem also a parable, that it bihoueth to preye euer more, and not faile;
and seide, There was a iuge in a citee, that dredde not God, nether schamede of men.
And a widowe was in that citee, and sche cam to hym, and seide, Venge me of myn aduersarie;
and he wolde not longe tyme. But aftir these thingis he seide with ynne hym silf, Thouy Y drede not God, and schame not of man,
netheles for this widewe is heuy to me, Y schal venge hir; lest at the laste sche comynge condempne me.
And the Lord seide, Here ye, what the domesman of wickidnesse seith;
and whether God schal not do veniaunce of hise chosun, criynge to hym dai and nyyt, and schal haue pacience in hem?
Sotheli Y seie to you, for soone he schal do veniaunce of hem. Netheles gessist thou, that mannus sone comynge schal fynde feith in erthe?
And he seide also to sum men, that tristiden in hem silf, as thei weren riytful, and dispiseden othere, this parable,
seiynge, Twei men wenten vp in to the temple to preye; the toon a Farisee, and the tother a pupplican.
And the Farisee stood, and preiede bi hym silf these thingis, and seide, God, Y do thankyngis to thee, for Y am not as other men, raueinouris, vniust, auoutreris, as also this pupplican;
Y faste twies in the woke, Y yyue tithis of alle thingis that Y haue in possessioun.
And the pupplican stood afer, and wolde nether reise hise iyen to heuene, but smoot his brest, and seide, God be merciful to me, synnere.
Treuli Y seie to you, this yede doun in to his hous, and was iustified fro the other. For ech that enhaunsith hym, schal be maad low, and he that mekith hym, schal be enhaunsid.
And thei brouyten to hym yonge children, that he schulde touche hem; and whanne the disciplis saien this thing, thei blameden hem.
But Jhesus clepide togider hem, and seide, Suffre ye children to come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem, for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes.
Treuli Y seie to you, who euer schal not take the kyngdom of God as a child, he schal not entre in to it.
And a prince axide hym, and seide, Goode maister, in what thing doynge schal Y weilde euerlastynge lijf?
And Jhesus seide to hym, What seist thou me good? No man is good, but God aloone.
Thou knowist the comaundementis, Thou schalt not sle, Thou schalt not do letcherie, Thou schalt not do theft, Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir.
Which seide, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe.
And whanne this thing was herd, Jhesus seide to hym, Yit o thing failith `to thee; sille thou alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresour in heuene; and come, and sue thou me.
Whanne these thingis weren herd, he was soreful, for he was ful ryche.
And Jhesus seynge hym maad sorie, seide, How hard thei that han money schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God;
for it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a nedlis iye, than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God.
And thei that herden these thingis seiden, Who may be maad saaf?
And he seide to hem, Tho thingis that ben impossible anentis men, ben possible anentis God.
But Petir seide, Lo! we han left alle thingis, and han sued thee.
And he seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to you, there is no man that schal forsake hous, or fadir, modir, or britheren, or wijf, or children, or feeldis, for the rewme of God,
and schal not resseyue many mo thingis in this tyme, and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf.
And Jhesus took hise twelue disciplis, and seide to hem, Lo! we gon vp to Jerusalem, and alle thingis schulen be endid, that ben writun bi the prophetis of mannus sone.
For he schal be bitraied to hethen men, and he schal be scorned, and scourgid, and bispat;
and aftir that thei han scourgid, thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde dai he schal rise ayen.
And thei vndurstoden no thing of these; and this word was hid fro hem, and thei vndurstoden not tho thingis that weren seid.
But it was don, whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerico, a blynde man sat bisidis the weie, and beggide.
And whanne he herde the puple passynge, he axide, what this was.
And thei seiden to hym, that Jhesus of Nazareth passide.
And he criede, and seide, Jhesu, the sone of Dauyd, haue mercy on me.
And thei that wenten bifor blamyden hym, that he schulde be stille; but he criede myche the more, Thou sone of Dauid, haue mercy on me.
And Jhesus stood, and comaundide hym to be brouyt forth to hym. And whanne he cam nyy, he axide hym,
and seide, What wolt thou that Y schal do to thee? And he seide, Lord, that Y se.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Biholde; thi feith hath maad thee saaf.
And anoon he say, and suede hym, and magnyfiede God. And al the puple, as it say, yaf heriyng to God.
And Jhesus `goynge yn, walkide thorou Jericho.
And lo! a man, Sache bi name, and this was a prince of pupplicans, and he was riche.
And he souyte to se Jhesu, who he was, and he myyte not, for the puple, for he was litil in stature.
And he ran bifore, and stiyede in to a sicomoure tree, to se hym; for he was to passe fro thennus.
And Jhesus biheld vp, whanne he cam to the place, and saiy hym, and seide to hym, Sache, haste thee, and come doun, for to dai Y mot dwelle in thin hous.
And he hiyynge cam doun, and ioiynge resseyuede hym.
And whanne alle men sayn, thei grutchiden seiynge, For he hadde turned to a synful man.
But Sache stood, and seide to the Lord, Lo! Lord, Y yyue the half of my good to pore men; and if Y haue ony thing defraudid ony man, Y yelde foure so myche.
Jhesus seith to hym, For to dai heelthe is maad to this hous, for that he is Abrahams sone;
for mannus sone cam to seke, and make saaf that thing that perischide.
Whanne thei herden these thingis, he addide, and seide a parable, for that he was nyy Jerusalem, `and for thei gessiden, that anoon the kyngdom of God schulde be schewid.
Therfor he seide, A worthi man wente in to a fer cuntre, to take to hym a kyngdom, and to turne ayen.
And whanne hise ten seruauntis weren clepid, he yaf to hem ten besauntis; and seide to hem, Chaffare ye, til Y come.
But hise citeseyns hatiden hym, and senten a messanger aftir hym, and seiden, We wolen not, that he regne on vs.
And it was don, that he turnede ayen, whan he hadde take the kyngdom; and he comaundide hise seruauntis to be clepid, to whiche he hadde yyue monei, to wite, hou myche ech hadde wonne bi chaffaryng.
And the firste cam, and seide, Lord, thi besaunt hath wonne ten besauntis.
He seide to hym, Wel be, thou good seruaunt; for in litil thing thou hast be trewe, thou schalt be hauynge power on ten citees.
And the tother cam, and seide, Lord, thi besaunt hath maad fyue besauntis.
And to this he seide, And be thou on fyue citees.
And the thridde cam, and seide, Lord, lo! thi besaunt, that Y hadde, put vp in a sudarie.
For Y dredde thee, for thou art `a sterne man; thou takist awey that that thou settidist not, and thou repist that that thou hast not sowun.
He seith to hym, Wickid seruaunt, of thi mouth Y deme thee. Wistist thou, that Y am `a sterne man, takynge awei that thing that Y settide not, and repyng ethat thing that Y sewe not?
and whi hast thou not youun my money to the bord, and Y comynge schulde haue axid it with vsuris?
And he seide to men stondynge nyy, Take ye awei fro hym the besaunt, and yyue ye to hym that hath ten beyauntis:
And thei seiden to hym, Lord, he hath ten besauntis.
And Y seie to you, to ech man that hath, it schal be youun, and he schal encreese; but fro him that hath not, also that thing that he hath, schal be takun of hym.
Netheles brynge ye hidur tho myn enemyes, that wolden not that Y regnede on hem, and sle ye bifor me.
And whanne these thingis weren seid, he wente bifore, and yede vp to Jerusalem.
And it was don, whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Bethfage and Betanye, at the mount, that is clepid of Olyuete, he sente hise twei disciplis, and seide,
Go ye in to the castel, that is ayens you; in to which as ye entren, ye schulen fynde a colt of an asse tied, on which neuer man sat; vntye ye hym, and brynge ye to me.
And if ony man axe you, whi ye vntien, thus ye schulen seie to hym, For the Lord desirith his werk.
And thei that weren sent, wenten forth, and fonden as he seide to hem, a colt stondynge.
And whanne thei vntieden the colt, the lordis of hym seiden to hem, What vntien ye the colt?
And thei seiden, For the Lord hath nede to hym.
And thei ledden hym to Jhesu; and thei castynge her clothis on the colt, setten Jhesu on hym.
And whanne he wente, thei strowiden her clothis in the weie.
And whanne he cam nyy to the comyng doun of the mount of Olyuete, al the puple that cam doun bygunnen to ioye, and to herie God with greet vois on alle the vertues, that thei hadden sayn,
and seiden, Blessid be the king, that cometh in the name of the Lord; pees in heuene, and glorie in hiye thingis.
And sum of the Farisees of the puple seiden to hym, Maister, blame thi disciplis.
And he seide to hem, Y seie to you, for if these ben stille, stoonus schulen crye.
And whanne he neiyede, `he seiy the citee,
and wepte on it, and seide, For if thou haddist knowun, thou schuldist wepe also; for in this dai the thingis ben in pees to thee, but now thei ben hid fro thin iyen.
But daies schulen come in thee, and thin enemyes schulen enuyroun thee with a pale, and thei schulen go aboute thee, and make thee streit on alle sidis,
and caste thee doun to the erthe, and thi sones that ben in thee; and thei schulen not leeue in thee a stoon on a stoon, for thou hast not knowun the tyme of thi visitacioun.
And he entride in to the temple, and bigan to caste out men sellynge ther inne and biynge,
and seide to hem, It is writun, That myn hous is an hous of preyer, but ye han maad it a den of theues.
And he was techynge euerydai in the temple. And the princis of prestis, and the scribis, and the princis of the puple souyten to lese hym;
and thei founden not, what thei schulden do to hym, for al the puple was ocupied, and herde hym.
And it was don in oon of the daies, whanne he tauyte the puple in the temple, and prechide the gospel, the princis of preestis and scribis camen togidere with the elder men;
and thei seiden to hym, Seie to vs, in what power thou doist these thingis, or who is he that yaf to thee this power?
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, And Y schal axe you o word; answere ye to me.
Was the baptym of Joon of heuene, or of men?
And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, seiynge, For if we seien, Of heuene, he schal seie, Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym?
and if we seien, Of men, al the puple schal stoone vs; for thei ben certeyn, that Joon is a prophete.
And thei answeriden, that thei knewen not, of whennus it was.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Nether Y seie to you, in what power Y do these thingis.
And he bigan to seie to the puple this parable. A man plauntide a vynyerd, and hiride it to tilieris; and he was in pilgrimage longe tyme.
And in the tyme of gaderynge of grapis, he sente a seruaunt to the tilieris, that thei schulden yyue to hym of the fruyt of the vynyerd; whiche beten hym, and leten hym go voide.
And he thouyte yit to sende another seruaunt; and thei beten this, and turmentiden hym sore, and leten hym go.
And he thouyte yit to sende the thridde, and hym also thei woundiden, and castiden out.
And the lord of the vyneyerd seide, What schal Y do? Y schal sende my dereworthe sone; perauenture, whanne thei seen hym, thei schulen drede.
And whanne the tilieris sayn hym, thei thouyten with ynne hem silf, and seiden, This is the eire, sle we hym, that the eritage be oure.
And thei castiden hym out of the vyneyerd, and killiden hym. What schal thanne the lord of the vyneyerd do to hem?
He schal come, and distruye these tilieris, and yyue the vyneyerd to othere. And whanne this thing was herd, thei seiden to hym, God forbede.
But he bihelde hem, and seide, What thanne is this that is writun, The stoon which men bildynge repreueden, this is maad in to the heed of the corner?
Ech that schal falle on that stoon, schal be to-brisid, but on whom it schal falle, it schal al to-breke him.
And the princis of prestis, and scribis, souyten to leye on hym hoondis in that our, and thei dredden the puple; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this liknesse.
And thei aspieden, and senten aspieris, that feyneden hem iust, that thei schulden take hym in word, and bitaak hym to the `power of the prince, and to the power of the iustice.
And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Maister, we witen, that riytli thou seist and techist; and thou takist not the persoone of man, but thou techist in treuthe the weie of God.
Is it leueful to vs to yyue tribute to the emperoure, or nay?
And he biheld the disseit of hem, and seide to hem, What tempten ye me?
Shewe ye to me a peny; whos ymage and superscripcioun hath it? Thei answerden, and seiden to hym, The emperouris.
And he seide to hem, Yelde ye therfor to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperours, and tho thingis that ben of God, to God.
And thei myyten not repreue his word bifor the puple; and thei wondriden in his answere, and heelden pees.
Summe of the Saduceis, that denyeden the ayenrisyng fro deeth to lijf, camen, and axiden hym,
and seiden, Maister, Moises wroot to vs, if the brother of ony man haue a wijf, and be deed, and he was with outen eiris, that his brothir take his wijf, and reise seed to his brother.
And so there weren seuene britheren. The firste took a wijf, and is deed with outen eiris;
and the brothir suynge took hir, and he is deed with outen sone;
and the thridde took hir; also and alle seuene, and leften not seed, but ben deed;
and the laste of alle the womman is deed.
Therfor in the `risyng ayen, whos wijf of hem schal sche be? for seuene hadden hir to wijf.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Sones of this world wedden, and ben youun to weddyngis;
but thei that schulen be had worthi of that world, and of the `risyng ayen fro deeth, nethir ben wedded,
nethir wedden wyues, nethir schulen mowe die more; for thei ben euen with aungels, and ben the sones of God, sithen thei ben the sones of `risyng ayen fro deeth.
And that deed men risen ayen, also Moises schewide bisidis the busch, as he seith, The Lord God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob.
And God is not of deed men, but of lyuynge men; for alle men lyuen to hym.
And summe of scribis answeringe, seiden, Maistir, thou hast wel seid.
And thei dursten no more axe hym ony thing.
But he seide to hem, How seien men, Crist to be the sone of Dauid,
and Dauid hym silf seith in the book of Salmes, The Lord seide to my lord, Sitte thou on my riythalf,
til that Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet?
Therfor Dauid clepith hym lord, and hou is he his sone?
And in heryng of al the puple, he seide to hise disciplis,
Be ye war of scribis, that wolen wandre in stolis, and louen salutaciouns in chepyng, and the firste chaieris in synagogis, and the firste sittynge placis in feestis;
that deuouren the housis of widewis, and feynen long preiyng; these schulen take the more dampnacioun.
And he biheeld, and saye tho riche men, that casten her yiftis in to the treserie;
but he saye also a litil pore widewe castynge twei ferthingis.
And he seide, Treuli Y seie to you, that this pore widewe keste more than alle men.
For whi alle these of thing that was plenteuouse to hem casten in to the yiftis of God; but this widewe of that thing that failide to hir, caste al hir liflode, that sche hadde.
And whanne sum men seiden of the temple, that it was apparailid with gode stoonus and yiftis,
he seide, These thingis that ye seen, daies schulen come, in whiche a stoon schal not be left on a stoon, which schal not be destried.
And thei axiden hym, and seiden, Comaundour, whanne schulen these thingis be? and what tokne schal be, whanne thei schulen bigynne to be don?
And he seide, Se ye, that ye be not disseyued; for many schulen come in my name, seiynge, For Y am, and the tyme schal neiye; therfor nyle ye go aftir hem.
And whanne ye schulen here batailis and stryues with ynne, nyle ye be aferd; it bihoueth first these thingis to be don, but not yit anoon is an ende.
Thanne he seide to hem, Folk schal rise ayens folk, and rewme ayens rewme;
grete mouyngis of erthe schulen be bi placis, and pestilencis, and hungris, and dredis fro heuene, and grete tokenes schulen be.
But bifore alle these thingis thei schulen sette her hoondis on you, and schulen pursue, bitakynge in to synagogis and kepyngis, drawynge to kyngis and to iusticis, for my name;
but it schal falle to you in to witnessyng.
Therfor putte ye in youre hertis, not to thenke bifore, hou ye schulen answere; for Y schal yyue to you mouth and wisdom,
to whiche alle youre aduersaries schulen not mowe ayenstonde, and ayenseie.
And ye schulen be takun of fadir, and modir, and britheren, and cosyns, and freendis, and bi deeth thei schulen turmente of you;
and ye schulen be in haate to alle men for my name.
And an heere of youre heed schal not perische;
in youre pacience ye schulen welde youre soulis.
But whanne ye schulen se Jerusalem ben enuyround with an oost, thanne wite ye, that the desolacioun of it schal neiye.
Thanne thei that ben in Judee, fle to the mountans; and thei that ben in the mydil of it, gon awei; and thei that ben in the cuntreis, entre not in to it.
For these ben daies of veniaunce, that alle thingis that ben writun, be fulfillid.
And wo to hem, that ben with child, and norischen in tho daies; for a greet diseese schal be on the erthe, and wraththe to this puple.
And thei schulen falle bi the scharpnesse of swerd, and thei schulen be led prisoneris in to alle folkis; and Jerusalem schal be defoulid of hethene men, til the tymes of naciouns be fulfillid.
And tokenes schulen be in the sunne, and the mone, and in the sterris; and in the erthe ouerleiyng of folkis, for confusioun of sown of the see and of floodis;
for men schulen wexe drye for drede and abidyng that schulen come to al the world; for vertues of heuenes schulen be mouyd.
And thanne thei schulen se mannys sone comynge in a cloude, with greet power and maieste.
And whanne these thingis bigynnen to be maad, biholde ye, and reise ye youre heedis, for youre redempcioun neiyeth.
And he seide to hem a liknesse, Se ye the fige tre, and alle trees,
whanne thei bryngen forth now of hem silf fruyt, ye witen that somer is nyy;
so ye, whanne ye seen these thingis to be don, wite ye, that the kyngdom of God is nyy.
Treuli Y seie to you, that this generacioun schal not passe, til alle thingis be don.
Heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my wordis schulen not passe.
But take ye heede to you silf, lest perauenture youre hertis be greuyd with glotony, and drunkenesse, and bisynessis of this lijf, and thilke dai come sodein on you; for as a snare it schal come on alle men,
that sitten on the face of al erthe.
Therfor wake ye, preiynge in ech tyme, that ye be hadde worthi to fle alle these thingis that ben to come, and to stonde bifor mannus sone.
And in daies he was techynge in the temple, but in nyytis he yede out, and dwellide in the mount, that is clepid of Olyuet.
And al the puple roos eerli, to come to hym in the temple, and to here hym.
And the halidai of therf looues, that is seid pask, neiyede.
And the princis of preestis and the scribis souyten, hou thei schulden sle Jhesu, but thei dredden the puple.
And Sathanas entride in to Judas, that was clepid Scarioth, oon of the twelue.
And he wente, and spak with the princis of preestis, and with the magistratis, hou he schulde bitray hym to hem.
And thei ioyeden, and maden couenaunt to yyue hym money.
And he bihiyte, and he souyte oportunyte, to bitraye hym, with outen puple.
But the daies of therf looues camen, in whiche it was neede, that the sacrifice of pask were slayn.
And he sente Petre and Joon, and seide, Go ye, and make ye redi to vs the pask, that we ete.
And thei seiden, Where wolt thou, that we make redi?
And he seide to hem, Lo! whanne ye schulen entre in to the citee, a man berynge a vessel of watir schal meete you; sue ye hym in to the hous, in to which he entrith.
And ye schulen seie to the hosebonde man of the hous, The maister seith to thee, Where is a chaumbre, where Y schal ete the pask with my disciplis?
And he schal schewe to you a greet soupyng place strewid, and there make ye redi.
And thei yeden, and founden as he seide to hem, and thei maden redi the pask.
And whanne the our was come, he sat to the mete, and the twelue apostlis with hym.
And he seide to hem, With desier Y haue desirid to ete with you this pask, bifor that Y suffre;
for Y seie to you, that fro this tyme Y schal not ete it, til it be fulfillid in the rewme of God.
And whanne he hadde take the cuppe, he dide gracis, and seide, Take ye, and departe ye among you;
for Y seie to you, that Y schal not drynke of the kynde of this vyne, til the rewme of God come.
And whanne he hadde take breed, he dide thankyngis, and brak, and yaf to hem, and seide, This is my bodi, that schal be youun for you; do ye this thing in mynde of me.
He took also the cuppe, aftir that he hadde soupid, and seide, This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood, that schal be sched for you.
Netheles lo! the hoond of hym that bitraieth me, is with me at the table.
And mannus sone goith, `aftir that it is determyned; netheles wo to that man, bi whom he schal be bitraied.
And thei bigunnen to seke among hem, who it was of hem, that was to do this thing.
And strijf was maad among hem, which of hem schulde be seyn to be grettest.
But he seide to hem, Kyngis of hethen men ben lordis of hem, and thei that han power on hem ben clepid good doeris, but ye not so;
but he that is grettest among you, be maad as yongere, and he that is bifor goere, as a seruaunt.
For who is gretter, he that sittith at the mete, or he that mynystrith? whether not he that sittith at the mete? And Y am in the myddil of you, as he that mynystrith.
And ye ben, that han dwellid with me in my temptaciouns; and Y dispose to you,
as my fadir hath disposid to me,
a rewme, that ye ete and drynke on my boord in my rewme, and sitte on trones, and deme the twelue kynredis of Israel.
And the Lord seide to Symount, Symount, lo, Satanas hath axid you, that he schulde ridile as whete; but Y haue preyede for thee,
that thi feith faile not; and thou sum tyme conuertid, conferme thi britheren.
Which seide to hym, Lord, Y am redi to go in to prisoun and in to deeth with thee.
And he seide, Y seie to thee, Petir, the cok schal not crowe to dai, til thou thries forsake that thou knowist me.
And he seide to hem, Whanne Y sente you with outen sachel, and scrippe, and schone, whether ony thing failide to you?
And thei seiden, No thing. Therfor he seide to hem, But now he that hath a sachel, take also and a scrippe; and he that hath noon, selle his coote, and bigge a swerd.
For Y seie to you, that yit it bihoueth that thing that is writun to be fulfillid in me, And he is arettid with wickid men; for tho thingis that ben of me han ende.
And thei seiden, Lord, lo! twei swerdis here. And he seide to hem, It is ynowy.
And he yede out, and wente aftir the custom in to the hille of Olyues; and the disciplis sueden hym.
And whanne he cam to the place, he seide to hem, Preye ye, lest ye entren in to temptacioun.
And he was taken awei fro hem, so myche as is a stonys cast; and he knelide,
and preyede, and seide, Fadir, if thou wolt, do awei this cuppe fro me; netheles not my wille be don, but thin.
And an aungel apperide to hym fro heuene, and coumfortide hym. And he was maad in agonye, and preyede the lenger;
and his swot was maad as dropis of blood rennynge doun in to the erthe.
And whanne he was rysun fro preier, and was comun to hise disciplis, he foond hem slepynge for heuynesse.
And he seide to hem, What slepen ye? Rise ye, and preye ye, that ye entre not in to temptacioun.
Yit while he spak, lo! a company, and he that was clepid Judas, oon of the twelue, wente bifor hem; and he cam to Jhesu, to kisse hym.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Judas, `with a coss `thou bytrayest `mannys sone.
And thei that weren aboute hym, and sayn that that was to come, seiden to hym, Lord, whether we smyten with swerd?
And oon of hem smoot the seruaunt of the prince of preestis, and kittide of his riyt eere.
But Jhesus answerde, and seide, Suffre ye til hidir. And whanne he hadde touchid his eere, he heelide hym.
And Jhesus seide to hem, that camen to hym, the princis of preestis, and maiestratis of the temple, and eldre men, As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues?
Whanne Y was ech dai with you in the temple, ye streiyten not out hondis in to me; but this is youre our, and the power of derknessis.
And thei token him, and ledden to the hous of the prince of prestis; and Petir suede hym afer.
And whanne a fier was kyndelid in the myddil of the greet hous, and thei saten aboute, Petir was in the myddil of hem.
Whom whanne a damysel hadde seyn sittynge `at the liyt, and hadde biholdun hym, sche seide, And this was with hym.
And he denyede hym, and seide, Womman, Y knowe hym not.
And aftir a litil another man siy hym, and seide, And thou art of hem. But Petir seide, A! man, Y am not.
And whanne a space was maad as of on our, another affermyd, and seide, Treuli this was with hym; for also he is of Galilee.
And Petir seide, Man, Y noot what thou seist. And anoon yit while he spak, the cok crewe.
And the Lord turnede ayen, and bihelde Petre; and Petre hadde mynde on the word of Jhesu, as he hadde seid, For bifor that the cok crowe, thries thou schalt denye me.
And Petre yede out, and wepte bittirli.
And the men that helden hym scorneden hym, and smyten hym.
And thei blynfelden hym, and smyten his face, and axiden hym, and seiden, Arede, thou Crist, to vs, who is he that smoot thee?
Also thei blasfemynge seiden ayens hym many other thingis.
And as the day was come, the eldre men of the puple, and the princis of prestis, and the scribis camen togidir, and ledden hym in to her councel,
and seiden, If thou art Crist, seie to vs.
And he seide to hem, If Y seie to you, ye schulen not bileue to me; and if Y axe, ye schulen not answere to me, nethir ye schulen delyuere me.
But aftir this tyme mannys sone schal be sittynge on the riyt half of the vertu of God.
Therfor alle seiden, Thanne art thou the sone of God? And he seide, Ye seien that Y am.
And thei seiden, What yit desiren we witnessyng? for we vs silf han herd of his mouth.
And al the multitude of hem arysen, and ledden hym to Pilat.
And thei bigunnen to accuse hym, and seiden, We han foundun this turnynge vpsodoun oure folk, and forbedynge tributis to be youun to the emperour, and seiynge that hym silf is Crist and kyng.
And Pilat axide hym, and seide, Art thou kyng of Jewis? And he answeride, and seide, Thou seist.
And Pilat seide to the princis of prestis, and to the puple, Y fynde no thing of cause in this man.
And thei woxen stronger, and seiden, He moueth the puple, techynge thorou al Judee, bigynnynge fro Galile til hidir.
And Pilat herynge Galile axide, if he were a man of Galile.
And whanne he knewe that he was of the powere of Eroude, he sente hym to Eroude; which was at Jerusalem in tho daies.
And whanne Eroude siy Jhesu, he ioyede ful myche; for long tyme he coueitide to se hym, for he herde many thingis of hym, and hopide to see sum tokene `to be don of hym.
And he axide hym in many wordis; and he answeride no thing to hym.
And the princis of preestis and the scribis stoden, stidfastli accusynge hym.
But Eroude with his oost dispiside hym, and scornede hym, and clothide with a white cloth, and sente hym ayen to Pilat.
And Eroude and Pilat weren maad freendis fro that dai; for bifor thei weren enemyes togidre.
And Pilat clepide togider the princis of prestis and the maiestratis of the puple, and seide to hem,
Ye han brouyt to me this man, as turnynge awey the puple, and lo! Y axynge bifor you fynde no cause in this man of these thingis, in whiche ye accusen hym;
nether Eroude, for he hath sent hym ayen to vs, and lo! no thing worthi of deth is don to hym.
And therfor Y schal amende hym, and delyuere hym.
But he moste nede delyuer to hem oon bi the feest dai.
And al the puple criede togidir, and seide, Do `awei hym, and delyuer to vs Barabas;
which was sent `in to prisoun for disturblyng maad in the cite, and for mansleynge.
And eftsoone Pilat spak to hem, and wolde delyuer Jhesu.
And thei vndurcrieden, and seiden, Crucifie, crucifie hym.
And the thridde tyme he seide to hem, For what yuel hath this don? Y fynde no cause of deeth in hym; therfor Y schal chastise hym, and Y schal delyuer.
And thei contynueden with greet voicis axynge, that he schulde be crucified; and the voicis of hem woxen stronge.
And Pilat demyde her axyng to be don.
And he delyueride to hem hym, that for mansleyng and sedicioun was sent in to prisoun, whom thei axiden; but he bitook Jhesu to her wille.
And whanne thei ledden hym, thei token a man, Symon of Syrenen, comynge fro the toun, and thei leiden on hym the cross to bere aftir Jhesu.
And there suede hym myche puple, and wymmen that weiliden, and bymorneden hym.
And Jhesus turnede to hem, and seide, Douytris of Jerusalem, nyle ye wepe on me, but wepe ye on youre silf and on youre sones.
For lo! daies schulen come, in whiche it schal be seid, Blessid be bareyn wymmen, and wombis that han not borun children, and the tetis that han not youun souke.
Thanne thei schulen bigynne to seie to mounteyns, Falle ye doun on vs, and to smale hillis, Keuere ye vs.
For if in a greene tre thei don these thingis, what schal be don in a drie?
Also othere twei wickid men weren led with hym, to be slayn.
And `aftir that thei camen in to a place, that is clepid of Caluerie, there thei crucifieden hym, and the theues, oon on the riyt half, and `the tother on the left half.
But Jhesus seide, Fadir, foryyue hem, for thei witen not what thei doon.
And thei departiden his clothis, and kesten lottis. And the puple stood abidynge; and the princis scorneden hym with hem, and seiden, Othere men he maad saaf; make he hym silf saaf, if this be Crist, the chosun of God.
And the knyytis neiyeden, and scorneden hym, and profreden vynegre to hym,
and seiden, If thou art king of Jewis, make thee saaf.
And the superscripcioun was writun ouer hym with Greke lettris, and of Latyn, and of Ebreu, This is the kyng of Jewis.
And oon of these theues that hangiden, blasfemyde hym, and seide, If thou art Crist, make thi silf saaf and vs.
But `the tothir answerynge, blamyde hym, and seide, Nether thou dredist God, that art in the same dampnacioun?
And treuli we iustli, for we han resseiued worthi thingis to werkis; but this dide no thing of yuel.
And he seide to Jhesu, Lord, haue mynde of me, whanne thou comest `in to thi kyngdom.
And Jhesus seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to thee, this dai thou schalt be with me in paradise.
And it was almest the sixte our, and derknessis weren maad in al the erthe `in to the nynthe our.
And the sun was maad derk, and the veile of the temple was to-rent atwo.
And Jhesus criynge with a greet vois, seide, Fadir, in to thin hoondis Y bitake my spirit. And he seiynge these thingis, yaf vp the goost.
And the centurien seynge that thing that was don, glorifiede God, and seide, Verili this man was iust.
And al the puple of hem that weren there togidir at this spectacle, and sayn tho thingis that weren don, smyten her brestis, and turneden ayen.
But alle his knowun stoden afer, and wymmen that sueden hym fro Galile, seynge these thingis.
And lo! a man, Joseph bi name, of Aramathie, a cite of Judee, that was a decurien, a good man and a iust,
this man concentide not to the counseil and to the dedis of hem; and he abood the kyngdom of God.
This Joseph cam to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu,
and took it doun, and wlappide it in a cleene lynen cloth, and leide hym in a graue hewun, in which not yit ony man hadde be leid.
And the dai was the euen of the halidai, and the sabat bigan to schyne.
And the wymmen suynge, that camen with hym fro Galile, sayn the graue, and hou his bodi was leid.
And thei turneden ayen, and maden redi swete smellynge spicis, and oynementis; but in the sabat thei restiden, aftir the comaundement.
But in o dai of the woke ful eerli thei camen to the graue, and brouyten swete smellynge spices, that thei hadden arayed.
And thei founden the stoon turned awei fro the graue.
And thei yeden in, and founden not the bodi of the Lord Jhesu.
And it was don, the while thei weren astonyed in thouyt of this thing, lo! twei men stoden bisidis hem in schynynge cloth.
And whanne thei dredden, and boweden her semblaunt in to the erthe, thei seiden to hem, What seken ye hym that lyueth with deed men?
He is not here, but is risun. Haue ye mynde, hou he spak to you, whanne he was yit in Galile,
and seide, For it bihoueth mannys sone to be bitakun in to the hondis of synful men, and to be crucified, and the thridde dai to rise ayen.
And thei bithouyten on hise wordis.
And thei yeden ayen fro the graue, and telden alle these thingis to the enleuene, and to alle othir.
And ther was Marie Mawdeleyn, and Joone, and Marie of James, and other wymmen that weren with hem, that seiden to apostlis these thingis.
And these wordis weren seyn bifor hem as madnesse, and thei bileueden not to hem.
But Petir roos vp, and ran to the graue; and he bowide doun, and say the lynen clothis liynge aloone. And he wente bi him silf, wondrynge on that that was don.
And lo! tweyne of hem wenten in that dai in to a castel, that was fro Jerusalem the space of sixti furlongis, bi name Emaws.
And thei spaken togidir of alle these thingis that haddun bifallun.
And it was don, the while thei talkiden, and souyten bi hem silf, Jhesus hym silf neiyede, and wente with hem.
But her iyen weren holdun, that thei knewen him not.
And he seide to hem, What ben these wordis, that ye speken togidir wandrynge, and ye ben sorewful?
And oon, whos name was Cleofas, answerde, and seide, Thou thi silf art a pilgrym in Jerusalem, and hast thou not knowun, what thingis ben don in it in these daies?
To whom he seide, What thingis? And thei seiden to hym, Of Jhesu of Nazareth, that was a man prophete, myyti in werk and word bifor God and al the puple;
and hou the heiyest preestis of oure princis bitoken hym in to dampnacioun of deeth, and crucifieden hym.
But we hopiden, that he schulde haue ayenbouyt Israel. And now on alle these thingis the thridde dai is to dai, that these thingis weren don.
But also summe wymmen of ouris maden vs afered, whiche bifor dai weren at the graue; and whanne his bodi was not foundun,
thei camen, and seiden, that thei syen also a siyt of aungels, whiche seien, that he lyueth.
And summe of oure wenten to the graue, and thei founden so as the wymmen seiden, but thei founden not hym.
And he seide to hem, A! foolis, and slowe of herte to bileue in alle thingis that the prophetis han spokun.
Whethir it bihofte not Crist to suffre these thingis, and so to entre in to his glorie?
And he bigan at Moises and at alle the prophetis, and declaride to hem in alle scripturis, that weren of hym.
And thei camen nyy the castel, whidur thei wenten. And he made countenaunce that he wolde go ferthere.
And thei constreyneden hym, and seiden, Dwelle with vs, for it drawith to nyyt, and the dai is now bowid doun.
And he entride with hem. And it was don, while he sat at the mete with hem, he took breed, and blesside, and brak, and took to hem.
And the iyen of hem weren openyd, and thei knewen hym; and he vanyschide fro her iyen.
And thei seiden togidir, Whether oure herte was not brennynge in vs, while he spak in the weie, and openyde to vs scripturis?
And thei risen vp in the same our, and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem, and founden the enleuene gaderid togidir, and hem that weren with hem,
seiynge, That the Lord is risun verrili, and apperide to Symount.
And thei tolden what thingis weren don in the weie, and hou thei knewen hym in brekyng of breed.
And the while thei spaken these thingis, Jhesus stood in the myddil of hem, and seide to hem, Pees to you; Y am, nyle ye drede.
But thei weren affraied and agast, and gessiden hem to se a spirit.
And he seide to hem, What ben ye troblid, and thouytis comen vp in to youre hertis?
Se ye my hoondis and my feet, for Y my silf am. Fele ye, and se ye; for a spirit hath not fleisch and boonys, as ye seen that Y haue.
And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he schewide hoondis and feet to hem.
And yit while thei bileueden not, and wondriden for ioye, he seide, Han ye here ony thing that schal be etun?
And thei proferden hym a part of a fisch rostid, and an hony combe.
And whanne he hadde etun bifore hem, he took that that lefte, and yaf to hem;
and seide `to hem, These ben the wordis that Y spak to you, whanne Y was yit with you; for it is nede that alle thingis ben fulfillid, that ben writun in the lawe of Moises, and in prophetis, and in salmes, of me.
Thanne he openyde to hem wit, that thei schulden vnderstonde scripturis.
And he seide to hem, For thus it is writun, and thus it bihofte Crist to suffre, and ryse ayen fro deeth in the thridde dai;
and penaunce and remyssioun of synnes to be prechid in his name `in to alle folkis, bigynnynge at Jerusalem.
And ye ben witnessis of these thingis.
And Y schal sende the biheest of my fadir in to you; but sitte ye in the citee, til that ye be clothid with vertu from an hiy.
And he ledde hem forth in to Betanye, and whanne his hondis weren lift vp, he blesside hem.
And it was don, the while he blesside hem, he departide fro hem, and was borun in to heuene.
And thei worschipiden, and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem with greet ioye,
and weren euermore in the temple, heriynge and blessynge God.
In the bigynnyng was the word, and the word was at God, and God was the word.
This was in the bigynnyng at God.
Alle thingis weren maad bi hym, and withouten hym was maad no thing, that thing that was maad.
In hym was lijf, and the lijf was the liyt of men; and the liyt schyneth in derknessis,
and derknessis comprehendiden not it.
A man was sent fro God, to whom the name was Joon.
This man cam in to witnessyng, that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt, that alle men schulden bileue bi hym.
He was not the liyt, but that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt.
There was a very liyt, which liytneth ech man that cometh in to this world.
He was in the world, and the world was maad bi hym, and the world knew hym not.
He cam in to his owne thingis, and hise resseyueden hym not.
But hou many euer resseyueden hym, he yaf to hem power to be maad the sones of God, to hem that bileueden in his name; the whiche not of bloodis,
nether of the wille of fleische, nether of the wille of man, but ben borun of God.
And the word was maad man, and dwellyde among vs, and we han seyn the glorie of hym, as the glorie of the `oon bigetun sone of the fadir, ful of grace and of treuthe.
Joon berith witnessyng of hym, and crieth, and seith, This is, whom Y seide, He that schal come aftir me, is maad bifore me, for he was tofor me;
and of the plente of hym we alle han takun, and grace for grace.
For the lawe was youun bi Moises; but grace and treuthe `is maad bi Jhesu Crist.
No man sai euer God, no but the `oon bigetun sone, that is in the bosum of the fadir, he hath teld out.
And this is the witnessyng of Joon, whanne Jewis senten fro Jerusalem prestis and dekenes to hym, that thei schulden axe hym, Who art thou?
He knoulechide, and denyede not, and he knoulechide, For Y am not Crist.
And thei axiden hym, What thanne? Art thou Elie? And he seide, Y am not. Art thou a profete? And he answeride, Nay.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, Who art thou? that we yyue an answere to these that senten vs. What seist thou of thi silf?
He seide, Y am a vois of a crier in deseert, Dresse ye the weie of the Lord, as Ysaie, the prophete, seide.
And thei that weren sent, weren of the Fariseis.
And thei axiden hym, and seiden to hym, What thanne baptisist thou, if thou art not Crist, nether Elie, nether a profete?
Joon answeride to hem, and seide, Y baptise in watir, but in the myddil of you hath stonde oon, that ye knowen not;
he it is, that schal come aftir me, that was maad bifor me, of whom Y am not worthi to louse the thwong of his schoo.
These thingis weren don in Bethanye biyende Jordan, where Joon was baptisyng.
Anothir day Joon say Jhesu comynge to hym, and he seide, Lo! the lomb of God; lo! he that doith awei the synnes of the world.
This is he, that Y seide of, Aftir me is comun a man, which was maad bifor me; for he was rather than Y.
And Y knew hym not, but that he be schewid in Israel, therfor Y cam baptisynge in watir.
And Joon bar witnessyng, and seide, That Y saiy the spirit comynge doun as a culuer fro heuene, and dwellide on hym.
And Y knew hym not; but he that sente me to baptise in watir, seide to me, On whom thou seest the Spirit comynge doun, and dwellynge on hym, this is he, that baptisith in the Hooli Goost.
And Y say, and bar witnessyng, that this is the sone of God.
Anothir dai Joon stood, and tweyne of hise disciplis;
and he biheeld Jhesu walkinge, and seith, Lo! the lomb of God.
And twei disciplis herden hym spekynge,
and folewiden Jhesu. And Jhesu turnede, and say hem suynge hym, and seith to hem, What seken ye? And thei seiden to hym, Rabi, that is to seie, Maistir, where dwellist thou?
And he seith to hem, Come ye, and se. And thei camen, and sayn where he dwellide; and dwelten with hym that dai. And it was as the tenthe our.
And Andrewe, the brother of Symount Petir, was oon of the tweyne, that herden of Joon, and hadden sued hym.
This foond first his brother Symount, and he seide to him, We han foundun Messias, that is to seie, Crist; and he ledde him to Jhesu.
And Jhesus bihelde hym, and seide, Thou art Symount, the sone of Johanna; thou schalt be clepid Cefas, that is to seie, Petre.
And on the morewe he wolde go out in to Galilee, and he foond Filip; and he seith to hym, Sue thou me.
Filip was of Bethsaida, the citee of Andrew and of Petre.
Filip foond Nathanael, and seide to hym, We han foundun Jhesu, the sone of Joseph, of Nazareth, whom Moyses wroot in the lawe and profetis.
And Nathanael seide to hym, Of Nazareth may sum good thing be?
Filip seide to hym, Come, and se. Jhesus siy Nathanael comynge to hym, and seide to hym, Lo! verili a man of Israel, in whom is no gile.
Nathanael seide to hym, Wherof hast thou knowun me? Jhesus `answerde, and seide to hym, Bifor that Filip clepide thee, whanne thou were vndur the fige tree, Y saiy thee. Nathanael answerde to hym,
`and seide, Rabi, thou art the sone of God, thou art kyng of Israel.
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, For Y seide to thee, Y sawy thee vndur the fige tre, thou bileuest; thou schalt se more than these thingis.
And he seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ye schulen se heuene opened, and the aungels of God stiynge vp and comynge doun on mannys sone.
And the thridde dai weddyngis weren maad in the Cane of Galilee; and the modir of Jhesu was there.
And Jhesus was clepid, and hise disciplis, to the weddyngis.
And whanne wijn failide, the modir of Jhesu seide to hym, Thei han not wijn.
And Jhesus seith to hir, What to me and to thee, womman? myn our cam not yit.
His modir seith to the mynystris, What euere thing he seie to you, do ye.
And there weren set `sixe stonun cannes, aftir the clensyng of the Jewis, holdynge ech tweyne ether thre metretis.
And Jhesus seith to hem, Fille ye the pottis with watir. And thei filliden hem, vp to the mouth.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Drawe ye now, and bere ye to the architriclyn. And thei baren.
And whanne the architriclyn hadde tastid the watir maad wiyn, and wiste not wherof it was, but the mynystris wisten that drowen the watir, the architriclyn clepith the spouse,
and seith to hym, Ech man settith first good wiyn, and whanne men ben fulfillid, thanne that that is worse; but thou hast kept the good wiyn `in to this tyme.
Jhesus dide this the bigynnyng of signes in the Cane of Galilee, and schewide his glorie; and hise disciplis bileueden in hym.
Aftir these thingis he cam doun to Cafarnaum, and his modir, and hise britheren, and hise disciplis; and thei dwelliden `there not many daies.
And the pask of Jewis was nyy, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem.
And he foond in the temple men sillynge oxun, and scheep, and culueris, and chaungeris sittynge.
And whanne he hadde maad as it were a scourge of smale cordis, he droof out alle of the temple, and oxun, and scheep; and he schedde the money of chaungeris, and turnede vpsedoun the boordis.
And he seide to hem that selden culueris, Take awei fro hennus these thingis, and nyle ye make the hous of my fadir an hous of marchaundise.
And hise disciplis hadden mynde, for it was writun, The feruent loue of thin hous hath etun me.
Therfor the Jewis answeriden, and seiden to hym, What token schewist thou to vs, that thou doist these thingis?
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Vndo ye this temple, and in thre daies Y schal reise it.
Therfor the Jewis seiden to hym, In fourti and sixe yeer this temple was bildid, and schalt thou in thre daies reise it?
But he seide of the temple of his bodi.
Therfor whanne he was risun fro deeth, hise disciplis hadden mynde, that he seide these thingis of his bodi; and thei bileueden to the scripture, and to the word that Jhesus seide.
And whanne Jhesus was at Jerusalem in pask, in the feeste dai, many bileueden in his name, seynge his signes that he dide.
But Jhesus trowide not hym silf to hem, for he knewe alle men;
and for it was not nede to hym, that ony man schulde bere witnessyng, for he wiste, what was in man.
And there was a man of the Farisees, Nychodeme bi name, a prince of the Jewis.
And he cam to Jhesu bi niyt, and seide to hym, Rabi, we witen, that thou art comun fro God maister; for no man may do these signes, that thou doist, but God be with hym.
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen, he may not se the kyngdom of God.
Nychodeme seide to hym, Hou may a man be borun, whanne he is eeld? whether he may entre ayen in to his modris wombe, and be borun ayen?
Jhesus answeride, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, but a man be borun ayen of watir, and of the Hooli Goost, he may not entre in to the kyngdom of God.
`That that is borun of the fleisch, is fleisch; and `that that is borun of spirit, is spirit.
Wondre thou not, for Y seide to thee, It bihoueth you to be borun ayen.
The spirit brethith where he wole, and thou herist his vois, but thou wost not, fro whennus he cometh, ne whidir he goith; so is ech man that is borun of the spirit.
Nychodeme answeride, and seide to hym, Hou moun these thingis be don?
Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou art a maister in Israel, and knowist not these thingis?
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, for we speken that that we witen, and we witnessen that that we han seyn, and ye taken not oure witnessyng.
If Y haue seid to you ertheli thingis, and ye bileuen not, hou if Y seie to you heueneli thingis, schulen ye bileue?
And no man stieth in to heuene, but he that cam doun fro heuene, mannys sone that is in heuene.
And as Moises areride a serpent in desert, so it bihoueth mannys sone to be reisid,
that ech man that bileueth in hym, perische not, but haue euerlastynge lijf.
For God louede so the world, that he yaf his `oon bigetun sone, that ech man that bileueth in him perische not, but haue euerlastynge lijf.
For God sente not his sone in to the world, that he iuge the world, but that the world be saued bi him.
He that bileueth in hym, is not demed; but he that bileueth not, is now demed, for he bileueth not in the name of the `oon bigetun sone of God.
And this is the dom, for liyt cam in to the world, and men loueden more derknessis than liyt; for her werkes weren yuele.
For ech man that doith yuele, hatith the liyt; and he cometh not to the liyt, that hise werkis be not repreued.
But he that doith treuthe, cometh to the liyt, that hise werkis be schewid, that thei ben don in God.
Aftir these thingis Jhesus cam, and hise disciplis, in to the loond of Judee, and there he dwellide with hem, and baptiside.
And Joon was baptisinge in Ennon, bisidis Salym, for many watris weren there; and thei camen, and weren baptisid.
And Joon was not yit sent in to prisoun.
Therfor a questioun was maad of Jonys disciplis with the Jewis, of the purificacioun.
And thei camen to Joon, and seiden `to hym, Maister, he that was with thee biyonde Jordan, to whom thou hast borun witnessyng, lo! he baptisith, and alle men comen to hym.
Joon answerde, and seide, A man may not take ony thing, but it be youun to hym fro heuene.
Ye you silf beren witnessyng to me, that Y seide, Y am not Crist, but that Y am sent bifore hym.
He that hath a wijf, is the hosebonde; but the freend of the spouse that stondith, and herith hym, ioieth with ioye, for the vois of the spouse. Therfor in this thing my ioye is fulfillid.
It bihoueth hym to wexe, but me to be maad lesse.
He that cam from aboue, is aboue alle; he that is of the erthe, spekith of the erthe; he that cometh from heuene, is aboue alle.
And he witnessith that thing that he hath seie, and herde, and no man takith his witnessing.
But he that takith his witnessyng, hath confermyd that God is sothefast.
But he whom God hath sent, spekith the wordis of God; for not to mesure God yyueth the spirit.
The fadir loueth the sone, and he hath youun alle thingis in his hoond.
He that bileueth in the sone, hath euerlastynge lijf; but he that is vnbileueful to the sone, schal not se euerlastynge lijf, but the wraththe of God dwellith on hym.
Therfor as Jhesu knew, that the Farisees herden, that Jhesu makith and baptisith mo disciplis than Joon,
thouy Jhesus baptiside not, but hise disciplis, he lefte Judee,
and wente ayen in to Galilee.
And it bihofte hym to passe bi Samarie.
Therfor Jhesus cam in to a citee of Samarie, that is seid Sicar, bisidis the place, that Jacob yaf to Joseph, his sone.
And the welle of Jacob was there; and Jhesus was weri of the iourney, and sat thus vpon the welle. And the our was, as it were the sixte.
And a womman cam fro Samarie, to drawe watir. And Jhesus seith to hir, Yyue me drynk.
And hise disciplis weren gon in to the citee, to bie mete.
Therfor thilke womman of Samarie seith to him, Hou thou, `whanne thou art a Jewe, axist of me drynk, that am a womman of Samarie? for Jewis vsiden not to dele with Samaritans.
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, If thou wistist the yifte of God, and who `he is, that seith to thee, Yyue me drynk, thou perauenture woldist haue axid of hym, and he schulde haue youun to thee quyk watir.
The womman seith to him, Sire, thou hast not where ynne to drawe, and the pit is deep; wherof thanne hast thou quik watir?
Whethir thou art grettere than oure fadir Jacob, that yaf to vs the pit? and he drank therof, and hise sones, and hise beestis.
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, Eche man that drynkith of this watir, schal thirste efte soone; but he that drynkith of the watir that Y schal yyue hym, schal not thirste with outen ende; but the watir that Y schal yyue hym,
schal be maad in hym a welle `of watir, spryngynge vp in to euerlastynge lijf.
The womman seith to hym, Sire, yyue me this watir, that Y thirste not, nether come hidur to drawe.
Jhesus seith to hir, Go, clepe thin hosebonde, and come hidir.
The womman answerde, and seide, Y haue noon hosebonde. Jhesus seith to hir, Thou seidist wel, That Y haue noon hosebonde;
for thou hast hadde fyue hosebondis, and he that thou hast, is not thin hosebonde. This thing thou seidist sotheli.
The womman seith to hym, Lord, Y se, that thou art a prophete.
Oure fadris worschipiden in this hil, and ye seien, that at Jerusalem is a place, where it bihoueth to worschipe.
Jhesus seith to hir, Womman, bileue thou to me, for the our schal come, whanne nether in this hil, nethir in Jerusalem, ye schulen worschipe the fadir.
Ye worschipen that ye knowen not; we worschipen that that we knowen; for helthe is of the Jewis.
But the tyme is comun, and now it is, whanne trewe worschiperis schulen worschipe the fadir in spirit and treuthe; for also the fadir sekith suche, that worschipen hym.
God is a spirit, and it bihoueth hem that worschipen hym, to worschipe in spirit and treuthe.
The womman seith to hym, Y woot that Messias is comun, that is seid Crist; therfor whanne he cometh, he schal telle vs alle thingis.
Jhesus seith to hir, Y am he, that spekith with thee.
And anoon hise disciplis camen, and wondriden, that he spak with the womman; netheles no man seide to hym, What sekist thou, or, What spekist thou with hir?
Therfor the womman lefte hir watir pot, and wente in to the citee, and seide to tho men,
Come ye, and se ye a man, that seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don; whether he be Crist?
And thei wenten out of the citee, and camen to hym.
In the mene while hise disciplis preieden hym, and seiden, Maistir, ete.
But he seide to hem, Y haue mete to ete, that ye knowen not.
Therfor disciplis seiden togidir, Whether ony man hath brouyt him mete to ete?
Jhesus seith to hem, My mete is, that Y do the wille of hym that sente me, that Y perfourme the werk of hym.
Whether ye seien not, that yit foure monethis ben, and rype corn cometh? Lo! Y seie to you, lifte vp youre iyen, and se ye the feeldis, for now thei ben white to repe.
And he that repith takith hire, and gaderith fruyt in to euerlastynge lijf; that bothe he that sowith, and he that repith, haue ioye togidere.
In this thing is the word trewe, for anothir is that sowith, and anothir that repith.
Y sente you to repe, that that ye `haue not trauelid; `othere men han trauelid, and ye han entrid `in to her trauels.
And of that citee many Samaritans bileueden in hym, for the word of the womman, that bare witnessyng, That he seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don.
Therfor whanne Samaritans camen to hym, thei preieden hym to dwelle there; and he dwelte there twey daies.
And many mo bileueden for his word,
and seiden to the womman, That now not for thi speche we bileuen; for we han herd, and we witen, that this is verili the sauyour of the world.
And aftir twei daies he wente out fro thennus, and wente in to Galilee.
And he bar witnessyng, that a profete in his owne cuntre hath noon onour.
Therfor whanne he cam in to Galilee, men of Galilee resseyueden hym, whanne thei hadden seyn alle thingis that he hadde don in Jerusalem in the feeste dai; for also thei hadden comun to the feeste dai.
Therfor he cam eftsoone in to the Cane of Galile, where he made the watir wiyn. And `a litil kyng was, whos sone was sijk at Cafarnaum.
Whanne this hadde herd, that Jhesu schulde come fro Judee in to Galilee, he wente to hym, and preiede hym, that he schulde come doun, and heele his sone; for he bigan to die.
Therfor Jhesus seide to him, But ye se tokenes and grete wondris, ye bileuen not.
The litil kyng seith to hym, Lord, come doun, bifor that my sone die.
Jhesus seith to hym, Go, thi sone lyueth. The man bileuede to the word, that Jhesus seide to hym, and he wente.
And now whanne he cam doun, the seruauntis camen ayens hym, and telden to hym, and seiden, That his sone lyuede.
And he axide of hem the our, in which he was amendid. And thei seiden to hym, For yistirdai in the seuenthe our the feuer lefte him.
Therfor the fadir knewe, that thilke our it was, in which Jhesus seide to hym, Thi sone lyueth; and he bileuede, and al his hous.
Jhesus dide eft this secounde tokene, whanne he cam fro Judee in to Galilee.
Aftir these thingis ther was a feeste dai of Jewis, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem.
And in Jerusalem is a waissynge place, that in Ebrew is named Bethsaida, and hath fyue porchis.
In these lay a greet multitude of sike men, blynde, crokid, and drie, abidynge the mouyng of the watir.
For the aungel `of the Lord cam doun certeyne tymes in to the watir, and the watir was moued; and he that first cam doun in to the sisterne, aftir the mouynge of the watir, was maad hool of what euer sijknesse he was holdun.
And a man was there, hauynge eiyte and thritti yeer in his sikenesse.
And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hym liggynge, and hadde knowun, that he hadde myche tyme, he seith to hym, Wolt thou be maad hool?
The sijk man answerde to hym, Lord, Y haue no man, that whanne the watir is moued, to putte me `in to the cisterne; for the while Y come, anothir goith doun bifor me.
Jhesus seith to hym, Rise vp, take thi bed, and go.
And anoon the man was maad hool, and took vp his bed, and wente forth. And it was sabat in that dai.
Therfor the Jewis seiden to him that was maad hool, It is sabat, it is not leueful to thee, to take awei thi bed.
He answeride to hem, He that made me hool, seide to me, Take thi bed, and go.
Therfor thei axiden him, What man `is that, that seide to thee, Take vp thi bed, and go?
But he that was maad hool, wiste not who it was. And Jhesus bowide awei fro the puple, that was set in the place.
Aftirward Jhesus foond hym in the temple, and seide to hym, Lo! thou art maad hool; now nyle thou do synne, lest any worse thing bifalle to thee.
Thilke man wente, and telde to the Jewis, that it was Jhesu that made hym hool.
Therfor the Jewis pursueden Jhesu, for he dide this thing in the sabat.
And Jhesus answeride to hem, My fadir worchith til now, and Y worche.
Therfor the Jewis souyten more to sle hym, for not oneli he brak the sabat, but he seide that God was his fadir, and made hym euene to God.
Therfor Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seye to you, the sone may not of hym silf do ony thing, but that thing that he seeth the fadir doynge; for what euere thingis he doith, the sone doith in lijk maner tho thingis.
For the fadir loueth the sone, and schewith to hym alle thingis that he doith; and he schal schewe to hym grettere werkis than these, that ye wondren.
For as the fadir reisith deed men, and quykeneth, so the sone quykeneth whom he wole.
For nethir the fadir iugith ony man, but hath youun ech doom to the sone,
that alle men onoure the sone, as thei onouren the fadir. He that onourith not the sone, onourith not the fadir that sente hym.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that he that herith my word, and bileueth to hym that sente me, hath euerlastynge lijf, and he cometh not in to doom, but passith fro deeth in to lijf.
Treuli, treuli Y seie to you, for the our cometh, and now it is, whanne deed men schulen here the vois of `Goddis sone, and thei that heren, schulen lyue.
For as the fadir hath lijf in hym silf, so he yaf to the sone, to haue lijf in him silf;
and he yaf to hym power to make doom, for he is mannys sone.
Nyle ye wondre this, for the our cometh, in which alle men that ben in birielis, schulen here the voice of Goddis sone.
And thei that han do goode thingis, schulen go in to ayenrisyng of lijf; but thei that han done yuele thingis, in to ayenrisyng of doom.
Y may no thing do of my silf, but as Y here, Y deme, and my doom is iust, for Y seke not my wille, but the wille of the fadir that sente me.
If Y bere witnessing of my silf, my witnessyng is not trewe;
another is that berith witnessyng of me, and Y woot that his witnessyng is trewe, that he berith of me.
Ye senten to Joon, and he bar witnessyng to treuthe.
But Y take not witnessyng of man; but Y seie these thingis, that ye be saaf.
He was a lanterne brennynge and schynynge; but ye wolden glade at an our in his liyt.
But Y haue more witnessyng than Joon, for the werkis that my fadir yaf to me to perfourme hem, thilke werkis that Y do beren witnessyng of me, that the fadir sente me.
And the fadir that sente me, he bar witnessyng of me. Nether ye herden euere his vois, nether ye seien his licnesse.
And ye han not his word dwellynge in you; for ye byleuen not to hym, whom he sente.
Seke ye scripturis, in which ye gessen to haue euerlastynge lijf; and tho it ben, that beren witnessyng of me.
And ye wolen not come to me, that ye haue lijf.
Y take not clerenesse of men;
but Y haue knowun you, that ye han not the loue of God in you.
Y cam in the name of my fadir, and ye token not me. If another come in his owne name, ye schulen resseyue hym.
Hou moun ye bileue, that resseyuen glorie ech of othere, and ye seken not the glorie `that is of God aloone?
Nyle ye gesse, that Y am to accuse you anentis the fadir; it is Moises that accusith you, in whom ye hopen.
For if ye bileueden to Moises, perauenture ye schulden bileue also to me; for he wroot of me.
But if ye bileuen not to hise lettris, hou schulen ye bileue to my wordis?
Aftir these thingis Jhesus wente ouere the see of Galilee, that is Tiberias.
And a greet multitude suede hym; for thei sayn the tokenes, that he dide on hem that weren sijke.
Therfor Jhesus wente in to an hil, and sat there with hise disciplis.
And the paske was ful niy, a feeste dai of the Jewis.
Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde lift vp hise iyen, and hadde seyn, that a greet multitude cam to hym, he seith to Filip, Wherof schulen we bie looues, that these men ete?
But he seide this thing, temptynge hym; for he wiste what he was to do.
Filip answerde to hym, The looues of tweyn hundrid pans sufficen not to hem, that ech man take a litil what.
Oon of hise disciplis, Andrew, the brothir of Symount Petre,
seith to him, A child is here, that hath fyue barli looues and twei fischis; but what ben these among so manye?
Therfor Jhesus seith, Make ye hem sitte to the mete. And there was myche hey in the place. And so men saten to the mete, as `fyue thousynde in noumbre.
And Jhesus took fyue looues, and whanne he hadde do thankyngis, he departide to men that saten to the mete, and also of the fischis, as myche as thei wolden.
And whanne thei weren fillid, he seide to hise disciplis, Gadir ye the relifs that ben left, that thei perischen not.
And so thei gadriden, and filliden twelue cofyns of relif of the fyue barli looues and twei fischis, that lefte to hem that hadden etun.
Therfor tho men, whanne thei hadden seyn the signe that he hadde don, seiden, For this is verili the profete, that is to come in to the world.
And whanne Jhesus hadde knowun, that thei weren to come to take hym, and make hym kyng, he fleiy `aloone eft in to an hille.
And whanne euentid was comun, his disciplis wenten doun to the see.
And thei wenten vp in to a boot, and thei camen ouer the see in to Cafarnaum. And derknessis weren maad thanne, and Jhesus was not come to hem.
And for a greet wynde blew, the see roos vp.
Therfor whanne thei hadden rowid as fyue and twenti furlongis or thretti, thei seen Jhesus walkynge on the see, and to be neiy the boot; and thei dredden.
And he seide to hem, Y am; nyle ye drede.
Therfor thei wolden take hym in to the boot, and anoon the boot was at the loond, to which thei wenten.
On `the tother dai the puple, that stood ouer the see, say, that ther was noon other boot there but oon, and that Jhesu entride not with hise disciplis in to the boot, but hise disciplis aloone wenten.
But othere bootis camen fro Tiberias bisidis the place, where thei hadden eetun breed, and diden thankyngis to God.
Therfor whanne the puple hadde seyn, that Jhesu was not there, nether hise disciplis, thei wenten vp in to bootis, and camen to Cafarnaum, sekynge Jhesu.
And whanne thei hadden foundun hym ouer the see, thei seiden to hym, Rabi, hou come thou hidur?
Jhesus answerde to hem, and seide, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ye seken me, not for ye sayn the myraclis, but for ye eten of looues, and weren fillid.
Worche ye not mete that perischith, but that dwellith in to euerlastynge lijf, which mete mannys sone schal yyue to you; for God the fadir hath markid hym.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, What schulen we do, that we worche the werkis of God?
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, This is the werk of God, that ye bileue to hym, whom he sente.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, What tokene thanne doist thou, that we seen, and bileue to thee? what worchist thou?
Oure fadris eeten manna in desert, as it is writun, He yaf to hem breed fro heuene to ete.
Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, Moyses yaf you not breed fro heuene, but my fadir yyueth you veri breed fro heuene;
for it is very breed that cometh doun fro heuene, and yyueth lijf to the world.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, Lord, euere yyue vs this breed.
And Jhesus seide to hem, Y am breed of lijf; he that cometh to me, schal not hungur; he that bileueth in me, schal neuere thirste.
But Y seid to you, that ye han seyn me, and ye bileueden not.
Al thing, that the fadir yyueth to me, schal come to me; and Y schal not caste hym out, that cometh to me.
For Y cam doun fro heuene, not that Y do my wille, but the wille of hym that sente me.
And this is the wille of the fadir that sente me, that al thing that the fadir yaf me, Y leese not of it, but ayen reise it in the laste dai.
And this is the wille of my fadir that sente me, that ech man that seeth the sone, and bileueth in hym, haue euerlastynge lijf; and Y schal ayen reyse hym in the laste dai.
Therfor Jewis grutchiden of hym, for he hadde seid, Y am breed that cam doun fro heuene.
And thei seiden, Whether this is not Jhesus, the sone of Joseph, whos fadir and modir we han knowun. Hou thanne seith this, That Y cam doun fro heuene?
Therfor Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Nyle ye grutche togidere.
No man may come to me, but if the fadir that sente me, drawe hym; and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai. It is writun in prophetis,
And alle men schulen be able for to be tauyt `of God. Ech man that herde of the fadir, and hath lerned, cometh to me.
Not for ony man hath sey the fadir, but this that is of God, hath sey the fadir.
Sotheli, sotheli, Y seie to you, he that bileueth in me, hath euerlastynge lijf.
Y am breed of lijf.
Youre fadris eeten manna in desert, and ben deed.
This is breed comynge doun fro heuene, that if ony man ete therof, he die not.
Y am lyuynge breed, that cam doun fro heuene.
If ony man ete of this breed, he schal lyue withouten ende. And the breed that Y schal yyue, is my fleisch for the lijf of the world.
Therfor the Jewis chidden togidere, and seiden, Hou may this yyue to vs his fleisch to ete?
Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, but ye eten the fleisch of mannus sone, and drenken his blood, ye schulen not haue lijf in you.
He that etith my fleisch, and drynkith my blood, hath euerlastynge lijf, and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai.
For my fleisch is veri mete, and my blood is very drynk.
He that etith my fleisch, and drynkith my blood, dwellith in me, and Y in hym.
As my fadir lyuynge sente me, and Y lyue for the fadir, and he that etith me, he schal lyue for me.
This is breed, that cam doun fro heuene. Not as youre fadris eten manna, and ben deed; he that etith this breed, schal lyue withouten ende.
He seide these thingis in the synagoge, techynge in Cafarnaum.
Therfor many of hise disciplis herynge, seiden, This word is hard, who may here it?
But Jhesus witynge at hym silf, that hise disciplis grutchiden of this thing, seide to hem, This thing sclaundrith you?
Therfor if ye seen mannus sone stiynge, where he was bifor?
It is the spirit that quykeneth, the fleisch profitith no thing; the wordis that Y haue spokun to you, ben spirit and lijf.
But ther ben summe of you that bileuen not. For Jhesus wiste fro the bigynnynge, which weren bileuynge, and who was to bitraye hym.
And he seide, Therfor Y seide to you, that no man may come to me, but it were youun to hym of my fadir.
Fro this tyme many of hise disciplis wenten abak, and wenten not now with hym.
Therfor Jhesus seide to the twelue, Whether ye wolen also go awei?
And Symount Petre answeride to hym, Lord, to whom schulen we gon? Thou hast wordis of euerlastynge lijf;
and we bileuen, and han knowun, that thou art Crist, the sone of God.
Therfor Jhesus answerde to hem, Whether Y chees not you twelue, and oon of you is a feend? And he seide this of Judas of Symount Scarioth, for this was to bitraye hym, whanne he was oon of the twelue.
Aftir these thingis Jhesus walkide in to Galilee, for he wolde not walke in to Judee, for the Jewis souyten to sle hym.
And ther was neiy a feeste dai of the Jewis, Senofegia.
And hise britheren seiden to hym, Passe fro hennus, and go in to Judee, that also thi disciplis seen thi werkis that thou doist;
for no man doith ony thing in hiddlis, and hym silf sekith to be opyn. If thou doist these thingis, schewe thi silf to the world.
For nether hise britheren bileueden in hym.
Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, My tyme cam not yit, but youre tyme is euermore redi.
The world may not hate you, sothely it hatith me; for Y bere witnessyng therof, that the werkis of it ben yuele.
Go ye vp to this feeste dai, but Y schal not go vp to this feeste dai, for my tyme is not yit fulfillid.
Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he dwelte in Galilee.
And aftir that hise britheren weren gon vp, thanne he yede vp to the feeste dai, not opynli, but as in priuyte.
Therfor the Jewis souyten hym in the feeste dai, and seiden, Where is he?
And myche grutchyng was of hym among the puple. For summe seiden, That he is good; and othere seiden, Nai, but he disceyueth the puple;
netheles no man spak opynli of hym, for drede of the Jewis.
But whanne the myddil feeste dai cam, Jhesus wente vp in to the temple, and tauyte.
And the Jewis wondriden, and seiden, Hou can this man lettris, sithen he hath not lerned?
Jhesus answerde to hem, and seide, My doctryne is not myn, but his that sente me.
If ony man wole do his wille, he schal knowe of the techyng, whethir it be of God, or Y speke of my silf.
He that spekith of hym silf, sekith his owne glorie; but he that sekith the glorie of hym that sente hym, is sothefast, and vnriytwisnesse is not in hym.
Whether Moises yaf not to you a lawe, and noon of you doith the lawe?
What seken ye to sle me? And the puple answerde, and seide, Thou hast a deuel; who sekith to sle thee?
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Y haue don o werk, and alle ye wondren.
Therfor Moises yaf to you circumcisioun; not for it is of Moyses, but of the fadris; and in the sabat ye circumciden a man.
If a man take circumcicioun in the sabat, that the lawe of Moises be not brokun, han ye indignacioun to me, for Y made al a man hool in the sabat?
Nile ye deme aftir the face, but deme ye a riytful doom.
Therfor summe of Jerusalem seiden, Whethir this is not he, whom the Jewis seken to sle?
and lo! he spekith opynli, and thei seien no thing to hym. Whether the princes knewen verili, that this is Crist?
But we knowun this man, of whennus he is; but whanne Crist schal come, no man woot of whennus he is.
Therfor Jhesus criede in the temple `techynge, and seide, Ye knowen me, and `ye knowen of whennus Y am; and Y cam not of my silf, but he is trewe that sente me, whom ye knowen not.
Y knowe hym, and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not, Y schal be lijk to you, a liere; but Y knowe hym, for of hym Y am, and he sente me.
Therfor thei souyten to take hym, and no man sette on hym hoondis, for his our cam not yit.
And many of the puple bileueden in hym, and seiden, Whanne Crist schal come, whether he schal do mo tokenes, than tho that this doith?
Farisees herden the puple musinge of hym these thingis; and the princis and Farisees senten mynystris, to take hym.
Therfor Jhesus seide to hem, Yit a litil tyme Y am with you, and Y go to the fadir, that sente me.
Ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen not fynde; and where Y am, ye may not come.
Therfor the Jewis seiden to hem silf, Whidur schal this gon, for we schulen not fynde hym? whether he wole go in to the scateryng of hethene men, and wole teche the hethene?
What is this word, which he seide, Ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen not fynde; and where Y am, ye moun not come?
But in the laste dai of the greet feeste, Jhesus stood, and criede, and seide, If ony man thirstith, come he to me, and drynke.
He that bileueth in me, as the scripture seith, Floodis of quyk watir schulen flowe fro his wombe.
But he seide this thing of the Spirit, whom men that bileueden in hym schulden take; for the Spirit was not yit youun, for Jhesus was not yit glorified.
Therfor of that cumpanye, whanne thei hadden herd these wordis of hym, thei seiden, This is verili a prophete.
Othere seiden, This is Crist. `But summe seiden, Whether Crist cometh fro Galilee?
Whether the scripture seith not, that of the seed of Dauid, and of the castel of Bethleem, where Dauid was, Crist cometh?
Therfor discencioun was maad among the puple for hym.
For summe of hem wolden haue take hym, but no man sette hondis on hym.
Therfor the mynystris camen to bischopis and Farisees, and thei seiden to hem, Whi brouyten ye not hym?
The mynystris answeriden, Neuere man spak so, as this man spekith.
Therfor the Farisees answeriden to hem, Whether ye ben disseyued also?
whether ony of the pryncis or of the Farisees bileueden in hym?
But this puple, that knowith not the lawe, ben cursid.
Nychodeme seith to hem, he that cam to hym bi nyyt, that was oon of hem, Whethir oure lawe demith a man,
but it haue first herde of hym, and knowe what he doith?
Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, Whether thou art a man of Galilee also? Seke thou scripturis, and se thou, that a prophete risith not of Galilee.
And thei turneden ayen, ech in to his hous.
But Jhesus wente in to the mount of Olyuete.
And eerli eft he cam in to the temple; and al the puple cam to hym; and he sat, and tauyte hem.
And scribis and Fariseis bryngen a womman takun in auoutrye, and thei settiden hir in the myddil,
and seiden to hym, Maystir, this womman is now takun in auoutrie.
And in the lawe Moises comaundide vs to stoone suche; therfor what seist thou?
And thei seiden this thing temptynge hym, that thei myyten accuse hym. And Jhesus bowide hym silf doun, and wroot with his fyngur in the erthe.
And whanne thei abiden axynge hym, he reiside hym silf, and seide to hem, He of you that is without synne, first caste a stoon in to hir.
And eft he bowide hym silf, and wroot in the erthe.
And thei herynge these thingis, wenten awei oon aftir anothir, and thei bigunnen fro the eldre men; and Jhesus dwelte aloone, and the womman stondynge in the myddil.
And Jhesus reiside hym silf, and seide to hir, Womman, where ben thei that accusiden thee? no man hath dampned thee.
Sche seide, No man, Lord. Jhesus seide `to hir, Nethir Y schal dampne thee; go thou, and now aftirward nyle thou synne more.
Therfor eft Jhesus spak to hem, and seide, Y am the liyt of the world; he that sueth me, walkith not in derknessis, but schal haue the liyt of lijf.
Therfor the Fariseis seiden, Thou berist witnessyng of thi silf; thi witnessyng is not trewe.
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, And if Y bere witnessyng of my silf, my witnessyng is trewe; for Y woot fro whennus Y cam, and whidur Y go.
But ye witen not fro whennus Y cam, ne whidur Y go. For ye demen aftir the fleisch, but Y deme no man;
and if Y deme, my doom is trewe, for Y am not aloone, but Y and the fadir that sente me.
And in youre lawe it is writun, that the witnessyng of twei men is trewe.
Y am, that bere witnessyng of my silf, and the fadir that sente me, berith witnessyng of me.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, Where is thi fadir? Jhesus answeride, Nether ye knowen me, nethir ye knowen my fadir; if ye knewen me, perauenture ye schulden knowe also my fadir.
Jhesus spak these wordis in the tresorie, techynge in the temple; and no man took hym, for his our cam not yit.
Therfor eft Jhesus seide to hem, Lo! Y go, and ye schulen seke me, and ye schulen die in youre synne; whidur Y go, ye moun not come.
Therfor the Jewis seiden, Whether he schal sle hym silf, for he seith, Whidur Y go, ye moun not come?
And he seide to hem, Ye ben of bynethe, Y am of aboue; ye ben of this world, Y am not of this world.
Therfor Y seide to you, that ye schulen die in youre synnes; for if ye bileuen not that Y am, ye schulen die in youre synne.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, Who art thou? Jhesus seide to hem, The bigynnyng, which also speke to you.
Y haue many thingis to speke, and deme of you, but he that sente me is sothefast; and Y speke in the world these thingis, that Y herde of hym.
And thei knewen not, that he clepide his fadir God.
Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Whanne ye han areisid mannus sone, thanne ye schulen knowe, that Y am, and of my silf Y do no thing; but as my fadir tauyte me, Y speke these thingis.
And he that sente me is with me, and lefte me not aloone; for Y do euermore tho thingis, that ben plesynge to hym.
Whanne he spak these thingis, manye bileueden in hym.
Therfor Jhesus seide to the Jewis, that bileueden in hym, If ye dwellen in my word, verili ye schulen be my disciplis;
and ye schulen knowe the treuthe, and the treuthe schal make you fre.
Therfor the Jewis answeriden to hym, We ben the seed of Abraham, and we serueden neuere to man; hou seist thou, That ye schulen be fre?
Jhesus answeride to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, ech man that doith synne, is seruaunt of synne.
And the seruaunt dwellith not in the hows with outen ende, but the sone dwellith with outen ende.
Therfor if the sone make you fre, verili ye schulen be fre.
Y woot that ye ben Abrahams sones, but ye seken to sle me, for my word takith not in you.
Y speke tho thingis, that Y say at my fadir; and ye doen tho thingis, that ye sayn at youre fadir.
Thei answerden, and seiden to hym, Abraham is oure fadir. Jhesus seith to hem, If ye ben the sones of Abraham, do ye the werkis of Abraham.
But now ye seken to sle `me, a man that haue spoken to you treuthe, that Y herde of God; Abraham dide not this thing.
Ye doen the werkis of youre fadir. Therfor thei seiden to hym, We ben not borun of fornycacioun; we han o fadir, God.
But Jhesus seith to hem, If God were youre fadir, sotheli ye schulden loue me; for Y passide forth of God, and cam; for nether Y cam of my silf, but he sente me.
Whi knowen ye not my speche? for ye moun not here my word.
Ye ben of the fadir, the deuel, and ye wolen do the desyris of youre fadir. He was a mansleere fro the bigynnyng, and he stood not in treuthe; for treuthe is not in hym. Whanne he spekith lesyng, he spekith of his owne; for he is a liere, and fadir of it.
But for Y seie treuthe, ye bileuen not to me.
Who of you schal repreue me of synne? if Y sey treuthe, whi bileuen ye not to me?
He that is of God, herith the wordis of God; therfor ye heren not, for ye ben not of God.
Therfor the Jewis answeriden, and seiden, Whether we seien not wel, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a deuel?
Jhesus answerde, and seide, Y haue not a deuel, but Y onoure my fadir, and ye han vnhonourid me.
For Y seke not my glorye; there is he, that sekith, and demeth.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, if ony man kepe my word, he schal not taste deth with outen ende.
Therfor the Jewis seiden, Now we han knowun, that thou hast a deuel. Abraham is deed, and the prophetis, and thou seist, If ony man kepe my word, he schal not taste deth withouten ende.
Whether thou art grettere than oure fader Abraham, that is deed, and the prophetis ben deed; whom makist thou thi silf?
Jhesus answeride, If Y glorifie my silf, my glorie is nouyt; my fadir, is that glorifieth me, whom ye seien, that he is youre God.
And ye han not knowun hym, but Y haue knowun hym; and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not, Y schal be a liere lich to you; but Y knowe hym, and Y kepe his word.
Abraham, youre fadir, gladide to se my dai; and he saiy, and ioyede.
Thanne the Jewis seiden to hym, Thou hast not yit fifti yeer, and hast thou seien Abraham?
Therfor Jhesus seide to hem, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, bifor that Abraham schulde be, Y am.
Therfor thei token stonys, to caste to hym; but Jhesus hidde hym, and wente out of the temple.
And Jhesus passynge, seiy a man blynd fro the birthe.
And hise disciplis axiden hym, Maistir, what synnede this man, or hise eldris, that he schulde be borun blynd?
Jhesus answeride, Nether this man synnede, nether hise eldris; but that the werkis of God be schewid in hym.
It bihoueth me to worche the werkis of hym that sente me, as longe as the dai is; the nyyt schal come, whanne no man may worche.
As longe as Y am in the world, Y am the liyt of the world.
Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he spette in to the erthe, and made cley of the spotil, and anoyntide the cley on hise iyen,
and seide to hym, Go, and be thou waisschun in the watir of Siloe, that is to seie, Sent. Thanne he wente, and waisschide, and cam seynge.
And so neiyboris, and thei that hadden seyn him bifor, for he was a beggere, seiden, Whether this is not he, that sat, and beggide?
Othere men seiden, That this it is; othere men seyden, Nai, but he is lijc hym.
But he seide, That Y am. Therfor thei seiden to hym, Hou ben thin iyen openyd?
He answerde, Thilke man, that is seid Jhesus, made clei, and anoyntide myn iyen, and seide to me, Go thou to the watre of Siloe, and wassche; and Y wente, and wasschide, and say.
And thei seiden to hym, Where is he? He seide, Y woot not.
Thei leden hym that was blynd to the Farisees.
And it was sabat, whanne Jhesus made cley, and openyde hise iyen.
Eft the Farisees axiden hym, hou he hadde seyn. And he seide to hem, He leide to me cley on the iyen; and Y wasschide, and Y se.
Therfor summe of the Fariseis seiden, This man is not of God, that kepith not the sabat. Othere men seiden, Hou may a synful man do these signes. And strijf was among hem.
Therfor thei seien eftsoone to the blynd man, What seist thou of hym, that openyde thin iyen? And he seide, That he is a prophete.
Therfor Jewis bileueden not of hym, that he was blynd, and hadde seyn, til thei clepiden his fadir and modir, that hadde seyn.
And thei axiden hem, and seiden, Is this youre sone, which ye seien was borun blynd? hou thanne seeth he now?
His fadir and modir answeriden to hem, and seiden, We witen, that this is oure sone, and that he was borun blynd;
but hou he seeth now, we witen neuer, or who openyde hise iyen, we witen nere; axe ye hym, he hath age, speke he of hym silf.
His fader and modir seiden these thingis, for thei dredden the Jewis; for thanne the Jewis hadden conspirid, that if ony man knoulechide hym Crist, he schulde be don out of the synagoge.
Therfor his fadir and modir seiden, That he hath age, axe ye hym.
Therfor eftsoone thei clepiden the man, that was blynd, and seiden to hym, Yyue thou glorie to God; we witen, that this man is a synnere.
Thanne he seide, If he is a synnere, Y woot neuer; o thing Y woot, that whanne Y was blynd, now Y se.
Therfor thei seiden to hym, What dide he to thee? hou openyde he thin iyen?
He answerde to hem, Y seide to you now, and ye herden; what wolen ye eftsoone here? whether ye wolen be maad hise discyplis?
Therfor thei cursiden hym, and seiden, Be thou his disciple; we ben disciplis of Moises.
We witen, that God spak to Moises; but we knowen not this, of whennus he is.
Thilke man answeride, and seide to hem, For in this is a wondurful thing, that ye witen not, of whennus he is, and he hath openyd myn iyen.
And we witen, that God herith not synful men, but if ony `man is worschypere of God, and doith his wille, he herith hym.
Fro the world it is not herd, that ony man openyde the iyen of a blynd borun man; but this were of God,
he myyt not do ony thing.
Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, Thou art al borun in synnes, and techist thou vs? And thei putten hym out.
Jhesus herd, that thei hadden putte hym out; and whanne he hadde founde hym, he seide to hym, Bileuest thou in the sone of God?
He answerde, and seide, Lord, who is he, that Y bileue in hym?
And Jhesus seide to hym, And thou hast seyn him, and he it is, that spekith with thee.
And he seide, Lord, Y byleue. And he felle doun, and worschipide hym.
Therfore Jhesus seide to hym, Y cam in to this world, `in to doom, that thei that seen not, see, and thei that seen, be maad blynde.
And summe of the Faryseis herden, that weren with hym, and thei seiden to hym, Whether we ben blynde?
Jhesus seide to hem, If ye weren blynde, ye schulden not haue synne; but now ye seien, That we seen, youre synne dwellith stille.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, he that cometh not in by the dore in to the foold of scheep, but stieth bi another weie, is a nyyt theef and a dai theef.
But he that entrith bi the dore, is the scheepherde of the scheep.
To this the porter openeth, and the scheep heren his vois, and he clepith his owne scheep bi name, and ledith hem out.
And whanne he hath don out his owne scheep, he goith bifor hem, and the scheep suen hym; for thei knowun his vois.
But thei suen not an alien, but fleen from hym; for thei han not knowun the vois of aliens.
Jhesus seide to hem this prouerbe; but thei knewen not what he spak to hem.
Therfor Jhesus seide to hem eftsoone, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that Y am the dore of the scheep.
As many as han come, weren nyyt theues and day theues, but the scheep herden not hem.
Y am the dore. If ony man schal entre bi me, he schal be sauyd; and he schal go ynne, and schal go out, and he schal fynde lesewis.
A nyyt theef cometh not, but that he stele, sle, and leese; and Y cam, that thei han lijf, and haue more plenteousli.
I am a good scheepherde; a good scheepherde yyueth his lijf for hise scheep.
But an hirid hyne, and that is not the scheepherde, whos ben not the scheep his owne, seeth a wolf comynge, and he leeueth the scheep, and fleeth; and the wolf rauyschith, and disparplith the scheep.
And the hirid hyne fleeth, for he is an hirid hyne, and it parteyneth not to hym of the scheep.
Y am a good scheepherde, and Y knowe my scheep, and my scheep knowen me.
As the fadir hath knowun me, Y knowe the fadir; and Y putte my lijf for my scheep.
Y haue othere scheep, that ben not of this foolde, and it bihoueth me to brynge hem togidir, and thei schulen here my vois; and it schal be maad o foolde and o scheepherde.
Therfor the fadir loueth me, for Y putte my lijf, that eftsoone Y take it.
No man takith it fro me, but Y putte it of my silf. Y haue power to putte it, and Y haue power to take it ayen. This maundement Y haue takun of my fadir.
Eft dissencioun was maad among the Jewis for these wordis.
And many of hem seiden, He hath a deuel, and maddith; what heren ye hym?
Othere men seiden, These wordis ben not of a man that hath a feend. Whether the deuel may opene the iyen of blynde men?
But the feestis of halewyng of the temple weren maad in Jerusalem, and it was wyntir.
And Jhesus walkide in the temple, in the porche of Salomon.
Therfor the Jewis camen aboute hym, and seiden to hym, Hou long takist thou awei oure soule? if thou art Crist, seie thou to vs opynli.
Jhesus answerde to hem, Y speke to you, and ye bileuen not; the werkis that Y do in the name of my fadir, beren witnessyng of me.
But ye bileuen not, for ye ben not of my scheep.
My scheep heren my vois, and Y knowe hem, and thei suen me.
And Y yyue to hem euerelastynge lijf, and thei schulen not perische with outen ende, and noon schal rauysche hem fro myn hoond.
That thing that my fadir yaf to me, is more than alle thingis; and no man may rauysche fro my fadris hoond.
Y and the fadir ben oon.
The Jewis token vp stoonys, to stoone hym.
Jhesus answerde to hem, Y haue schewide to you many good werkis of my fadir, for which werk of hem stonen ye me?
The Jewis answerden to hym, We stoonen thee not of good werk, but of blasfemye, and for thou, sithen thou art a man, makist thi silf God.
Jhesus answerde to hem, Whether it is not writun in youre lawe, That Y seide, Ye ben goddis?
Yf he seide that thei weren goddis, to whiche the word of God was maad, and scripture may not be vndon,
thilke that the fadir hath halewid, and hath sent in to the world, ye seien, That `thou blasfemest, for Y seide, Y am Goddis sone?
Yf Y do not the werkis of my fadir, nyle ye bileue to me;
but if Y do, thouy ye wolen not bileue to me, bileue ye to the werkis; that ye knowe and bileue, that the fadir is in me, and Y in the fadir.
Therfor thei souyten to take hym, and he wente out of her hondis.
And he wente eftsoone ouer Jordan, in to that place where Joon was firste baptisynge, and he dwelte there.
And manye camen to hym, and seiden, For Joon dide no myracle;
and alle thingis what euer Joon seide of this, weren sothe. And many bileueden in hym.
And ther was a sijk man, Lazarus of Bethanye, of the castel of Marie and Martha, hise sistris.
And it was Marye, which anoyntide the Lord with oynement, and wipte hise feet with hir heeris, whos brother Lazarus was sijk.
Therfor hise sistris senten to hym, and seide, Lord, lo! he whom thou louest, is sijk.
And Jhesus herde, and seide to hem, This syknesse is not to the deth, but for the glorie of God, that mannus sone be glorified bi hym.
And Jhesus louyde Martha, and hir sistir Marie, and Lazarus.
Therfor whanne Jhesus herde, that he was sijk, thanne he dwellide in the same place twei daies.
And after these thingis he seide to hise disciplis, Go we eft in to Judee.
The disciplis seien to hym, Maister, now the Jewis souyten for to stoone thee, and eft goist thou thidir?
Jhesus answerde, Whether ther ben not twelue ouris of the dai? If ony man wandre in the dai, he hirtith not, for he seeth the liyt of this world.
But if he wandre in the niyt, he stomblith, for liyt is not in him.
He seith these thingis, and aftir these thingis he seith to hem, Lazarus, oure freend, slepith, but Y go to reise hym fro sleep.
Therfor hise disciplis seiden, Lord, if he slepith, he schal be saaf.
But Jhesus hadde seid of his deth; but thei gessiden, that he seide of slepyng of sleep.
Thanne therfor Jhesus seide to hem opynli, Lazarus is deed;
and Y haue ioye for you, that ye bileue, for Y was not there; but go we to hym.
Therfor Thomas, that is seid Didymus, seide to euen disciplis, Go we also, that we dien with hym.
And so Jhesus cam, and foond hym hauynge thanne foure daies in the graue.
And Bethany was bisidis Jerusalem, as it were fiftene furlongis.
And many of the Jewis camen to Mary and Martha, to coumforte hem of her brothir.
Therfor as Martha herde, that Jhesu cam, sche ran to hym; but Mary sat at home.
Therfor Martha seide to Jhesu, Lord, if thou haddist be here, my brother hadde not be deed.
But now Y woot, that what euere thingis thou schalt axe of God, God schal yyue to thee.
Jhesus seith to hir, Thi brother schal rise ayen.
Martha seith to hym, Y woot, that he schal rise ayen in the ayen risyng in the laste dai.
Jhesus seith to hir, Y am ayen risyng and lijf; he that bileueth in me, yhe, thouy he be deed,
he schal lyue; and ech that lyueth, and bileueth in me, schal not die with outen ende. Bileuest thou this thing?
Sche seith to hym, Yhe, Lord, Y haue bileued, that thou art Crist, the sone of the lyuynge God, that hast come in to this world.
And whanne sche hadde seid this thing, sche wente, and clepide Marie, hir sistir, in silence, and seide, The maister cometh, and clepith thee.
Sche, as sche herd, aroos anoon, and cam to hym.
And Jhesus cam not yit `in to the castel, but he was yit in that place, where Martha hadde comun ayens hym.
Therfor the Jewis that weren with hir in the hous, and coumfortiden hir, whanne thei sayn Marie, that sche roos swithe, and wente out, thei sueden hir, and seiden, For sche goith to the graue, to wepe there.
But whanne Marie was comun where Jhesus was, sche seynge hym felde doun to his feet, and seide to hym, Lord, if thou haddist be here, my brother hadde not be deed.
And therfor whanne Jhesu saiy hir wepyng, and the Jewis wepynge that weren with hir, he `made noise in spirit, and troblide hym silf,
and seide, Where han ye leid hym? Thei seien to hym, Lord, come, and se.
And Jhesus wepte.
Therfor the Jewis seiden, Lo! hou he louede hym.
And summe of hem seiden, Whethir this man that openyde the iyen of the borun blynde man, myyte not make that this schulde not die?
Therfor Jhesus eft makynge noise in hym silf, cam to the graue. And there was a denne, and a stoon was leid theronne.
And Jhesus seith, Take ye awey the stoon. Martha, the sistir of hym that was deed, seith to hym, Lord, he stynkith now, for he hath leye foure daies.
Jhesus seith to hir, Haue Y not seid to thee, that if thou bileuest, thou schalt se the glorie of God?
Therfor thei token awei the stoon. And Jhesus lifte vp hise iyen, and seide, Fadir, Y do thankyngis to thee, for thou hast herd me; and Y wiste,
that thou euermore herist me, but for the puple that stondith aboute, Y seide, that thei bileue, that thou hast sent me.
Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he criede with a greet vois, Lazarus, come thou forth.
And anoon he that was deed, cam out, boundun the hondis and feet with boondis, and his face boundun with a sudarie. And Jhesus seith to hem, Vnbynde ye hym, and suffre ye hym to go forth.
Therfor many of the Jewis that camen to Marie and Martha, and seyn what thingis Jhesus dide, bileueden in hym.
But summe of hem wente to the Farisees, and seiden to hem, what thingis Jhesus `hadde don.
Therfor the bischopis and the Farisees gadriden a counsel ayens Jhesu, and seiden, What do we? for this man doith many myraclis.
If we leeue hym thus, alle men schulen bileue in hym; and Romayns schulen come, and schulen take our place and oure folk.
But oon of hem, Cayfas bi name, whanne he was bischop of that yeer, seide to hem,
Ye witen nothing, ne thenken, that it spedith to you, that o man die for the puple, and that al the folc perische not.
But he seide not this thing of hym silf, but whanne he was bischop of that yeer, he prophesiede, that Jhesu was to die for the folc,
and not oneli for the folc, but that he schulde gadere in to oon the sones of God that weren scaterid.
Therfor fro that day thei souyten for to sle hym.
Therfor Jhesus walkide not thanne opynli among the Jewis; but he wente in to a cuntre bisidis desert, in to a citee, that is seid Effren, and there he dwellide with hise disciplis.
And the pask of the Jewis was niy, and many of the cuntrey wenten vp to Jerusalem bifor the pask, to halewe hem silf.
Therfor thei souyten Jhesu, and spaken togidere, stondynge in the temple, What gessen ye, for he cometh not to the feeste day?
For the bischopis and Farisees hadden youun a maundement, that if ony man knowe where he is, that he schewe, that thei take hym.
Therfor Jhesus bifor sixe daies of pask cam to Bethanye, where Lazarus hadde be deed, whom Jhesus reiside.
And thei maden to hym a soopere there, and Martha mynystride to hym; and Lazarus was oon of men that saten at the mete with hym.
Therfor Marie took a pound of oynement of trewe narde precious, and anoyntide the feet of Jhesu, and wipte hise feet with hir heeris; and the hous was fulfillid of the sauour of the oynement.
Therfor Judas Scarioth, oon of hise disciplis, that was to bitraye hym,
seide, Whi is not this oynement seeld for thre hundrid pens, and is youun to nedi men?
But he seide this thing, not for it perteynede to hym of nedi men, but for he was a theef, and he hadde the pursis, and bar tho thingis that weren sent.
Therfor Jhesus seide, Suffre ye hir, that in to the day of my biriyng sche kepe that;
for ye schulen euermore haue pore men with you, but ye schulen not euermore haue me.
Therfore myche puple of Jewis knew, that Jhesus was there; and thei camen, not oonli for Jhesu, but to se Lazarus, whom he hadde reisid fro deth.
But the princis of prestis thouyten to sle Lazarus,
for manye of the Jewis wenten awei for him, and bileueden in Jhesu.
But on the morew a myche puple, that cam togidere to the feeste dai, whanne thei hadden herd, that Jhesus cam to Jerusalem,
token braunchis of palmes, and camen forth ayens hym, and crieden, Osanna, blessid is the kyng of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
And Jhesus foond a yonge asse, and sat on hym,
as it is writun, The douytir of Syon, nyle thou drede; lo! thi kyng cometh, sittynge on `an asse fole.
Hise disciplis knewen not first these thingis, but whanne Jhesus was glorified, thanne thei hadden mynde, for these thingis weren writun of hym, and these thingis thei diden to hym.
Therfor the puple bar witnessyng, that was with hym, whanne he clepide Lazarus fro the graue, and reiside hym fro deth.
And therfor the puple cam, and mette with hym, for thei herden that he hadde don this signe.
Therfor the Farisees seiden to hem silf, Ye seen, that we profiten no thing; lo! al the world wente aftir hym.
And there weren summe hethene men, of hem that hadden come vp to worschipe in the feeste dai.
And these camen to Filip, that was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and preieden hym, and seiden, Sire, we wolen se Jhesu.
Filip cometh, and seith to Andrew; eft Andrew and Filip seiden to Jhesu.
And Jhesus answerde `to hem, and seide, The our cometh, that mannus sone be clarified.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, but a corn of whete falle in to the erthe, and be deed, it dwellith aloone;
but if it be deed, it bryngith myche fruyt. He that loueth his lijf, schal leese it; and he that hatith his lijf in this world, kepith it in to euerlastynge lijf.
If ony man serue me, sue he me; and where Y am, there my mynystre schal be. If ony man serue me, my fadir schal worschipe hym.
Now my soule is troublid, and what schal Y seie? Fadir, saue me fro this our; but therfor Y cam in to this our;
fadir, clarifie thi name. And a vois cam fro heuene, and seide, And Y haue clarified, and eft Y schal clarifie.
Therfor the puple that stood, and herde, seide, that `thundur was maad; othere men seide, an aungel spak to hym.
Jhesus answerde, and seide, This vois cam not for me, but for you.
Now is the doom of the world, now the prince of this world schal be cast out.
And if Y schal be enhaunsid fro the erthe, Y schal drawe alle thingis to my silf.
And he seide this thing, signifiynge bi what deth he `was to die.
And the puple answeride to hym, We han herd of the lawe, that Crist dwellith with outen ende; and hou seist thou, It bihoueth mannys sone to be arerid?
Who is this mannus sone? And thanne Jhesus seith to hem, Yit a litil liyt is in you; walke ye, the while ye han liyt, that derknessis catche you not; he that wandrith in derknessis, woot nere whidur he goith.
While ye han liyt, bileue ye in liyt, that ye be the children of liyt. Jhesus spak these thingis, and wente, and hidde hym fro hem.
And whanne he hadde don so many myraclis bifor hem, thei bileueden not `in to hym;
that the word of Ysaie, the prophete, schulde be fulfillid, which he seide, Lord, who bileuede to oure heryng, and to whom is the arm of the Lord schewid?
Therfor thei myyten not bileue, for eft Ysaye seide,
He hath blyndid her iyen, and he hath maad hard the herte of hem, that thei se not with iyen, and vndurstonde with herte; and that thei be conuertid, and Y heele hem.
Ysaye seide these thingis, whanne he say the glorie of hym, and spak of hym.
Netheles `of the pryncis manye bileueden in hym, but for the Farisees thei knowlechiden not, that thei schulden not be put out of the synagoge;
for thei loueden the glorie of men, more than the glorie of God.
And Jhesus criede, and seide, He that bileueth in me, bileueth not in me, but in hym that sente me.
He that seeth me, seeth hym that sente me.
Y liyt cam in to the world, that ech that bileueth in me, dwelle not in derknessis.
And if ony man herith my words, and kepith hem, Y deme hym not; for Y cam not, that Y deme the world, but that Y make the world saaf.
He that dispisith me, and takith not my wordis, hath hym that schal iuge hym; thilke word that Y haue spokun, schal deme hym in the last dai.
For Y haue not spokun of my silf, but thilke fadir that sente me, yaf to me a maundement, what Y schal seie, and what Y schal speke.
And Y woot, that his maundement is euerlastynge lijf; therfor tho thingis that Y speke, as the fadir seide to me, so Y speke.
Bifor the `feeste dai of pask Jhesus witynge, that his our is comun, that he passe fro this world to the fadir, whanne he hadde loued hise that weren in the world, in to the ende he louede hem.
And whanne the souper was maad, whanne the deuel hadde put than in to the herte, that Judas of Symount Scarioth schulde bitraye hym,
he witynge that the fadir yaf alle thingis to hym in to hise hoondis, and that he wente out fro God,
and goith to God, he risith fro the souper, and doith of hise clothis; and whanne he hadde takun a lynun cloth, he girde hym.
And aftirward he putte watir in to a basyn, and biganne to waische the disciplis feet, and to wipe with the lynnen cloth, with which he was gird.
And so he cam to Symount Petre, and Petre seith to hym, Lord, waischist thou my feet?
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, What Y do, thou wost not now; but thou schalt wite aftirward.
Petre seith to hym, Thou schalt neuere waische my feet. Jhesus answeride to hym, If Y schal not waische thee, thou schalt not haue part with me.
Symount Petre seith to hym, Lord, not oneli my feet, but bothe the hoondis and the heed.
Jhesus seide to hym, He that is waischun, hath no nede but that he waische the feet, but he is al clene; and ye ben clene, but not alle.
For he wiste, who `was he that schulde bitraye hym; therfor he seide, Ye ben not alle clene.
And so aftir that he hadde waischun `the feet of hem, he took hise clothis; and whanne he was set to mete ayen, eft he seide to hem, Ye witen what Y haue don to you.
Ye clepen me maistir and lord, and ye seien wel; for Y am.
Therfor if Y, lord and maistir, haue waischun youre feet, and ye schulen waische oon anothers feet;
for Y haue youun `ensaumple to you, `that as I haue do to you, so do ye.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, the seruaunt is not grettere than his lord, nether an apostle is grettere than he that sente hym.
If ye witen these thingis, ye schulen be blessid, if ye doen hem.
Y seie not of `alle you, Y woot whiche Y haue chosun; but that the scripture be fulfillid, He that etith my breed, schal reise his heele ayens me.
Treuly, Y seie to you bifor it be don, that whanne it is don, ye bileue that Y am.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, he that takith whom euere Y schal sende, resseyueth me; and he that resseyueth me, resseyueth hym that sente me.
Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis, he was troblid in spirit, and witnesside, and seide, Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that oon of you schal bitraye me.
Therfor the disciplis lokiden togidere, doutynge of whom he seide.
And so oon of hise disciplis was restynge in the bosum of Jhesu, whom Jhesu louede.
Therfor Symount Petre bikeneth to hym, `and seith to hym, Who is it, of whom he seith?
And so whanne he hadde restid ayen on the brest of Jhesu, he seith to hym, Lord, who is it?
Jhesus answerde, He it is, to whom Y schal areche a sop of breed. And whanne he hadde wet breed, he yaf to Judas of Symount Scarioth.
And aftir the mussel, thanne Sathanas entride in to hym. And Jhesus seith to hym, That thing that thou doist, do thou swithe.
And noon of hem that saten at the mete wiste, wherto he seide to hym.
For summe gessiden, for Judas hadde pursis, that Jhesus hadde seid to hym, Bie thou tho thingis, that ben nedeful to vs to the feeste dai, or that he schulde yyue sum thing to nedi men.
Therfor whanne he hadde takun the mussel, he wente out anoon; and it was nyyt.
And whanne he was gon out, Jhesus seide, Now mannus sone is clarified, and God is clarified in hym.
If God is clarified in hym, God schal clarifie hym in hym silf, and anoon he schal clarifie hym.
Litle sones, yit a litil Y am with you; ye schulen seke me, and, as Y seide to the Jewis, Whidur Y go, ye moun not come; and to you Y seie now.
Y yyue to you a newe maundement, that ye loue togidir, as Y louede you, `and that ye loue togidir.
In this thing alle men schulen knowe, that ye ben my disciplis, if ye han loue togidere.
Symount Petre seith to hym, Lord, whidur goist thou? Jhesus answeride, Whidur Y go, thou mayst not sue me now, but thou schalt sue afterward.
Petre seith to hym, Whi may Y not sue thee now? Y schal putte my lijf for thee.
Jhesus answeride, Thou schalt putte thi lijf for me? Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, the cok schal not crowe, til thou schalt denye me thries. And he seith to hise disciplis.
Be not youre herte afraied, ne drede it; ye bileuen in God, and bileue ye in me.
In the hous of my fadir ben many dwellyngis; if ony thing lesse, Y hadde seid to you, for Y go to make redi to you a place.
And if Y go, and make redi to you a place, eftsoones Y come, and Y schal take you to my silf, that where Y am, ye be.
And whidur Y go, ye witen, and ye witen the weie.
Thomas seith to hym, Lord, we witen not whidur thou goist, and hou moun we wite the weie?
Jhesus seith to hym, Y am weie, treuthe, and lijf; no man cometh to the fadir, but bi me.
If ye hadden knowe me, sotheli ye hadden knowe also my fadir; and aftirward ye schulen knowe hym, and ye han seyn hym.
Filip seith to hym, Lord, schewe to vs the fadir, and it suffisith to vs.
Jhesus seith to hym, So long tyme Y am with you, and `han ye not knowun me? Filip, he that seeth me, seeth also the fadir. Hou seist thou, schewe to vs the fadir?
Bileuest thou not, that Y am in the fadir, and the fadir is in me? The wordis that Y speke to you, Y speke not of my silf; but the fadir hym silf dwellynge in me, doith the werkis.
Bileue ye not, that Y am in the fadir, and the fadir is in me?
Ellis bileue ye for thilke werkis. Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, if a man bileueth in me, also he schal do the werkis that Y do; and he schal do grettere werkis than these, for Y go to the fadir.
And what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name, Y schal do this thing, that the fadir be glorified in the sone.
If ye axen ony thing in my name, Y schal do it.
If ye louen me, kepe ye my comaundementis.
And Y schal preye the fadir, and he schal yyue to you another coumfortour,
the spirit of treuthe, to dwelle with you with outen ende; which spirit the world may not take, for it seeth hym not, nether knowith hym. But ye schulen knowe hym, for he schal dwelle with you, and he schal be in you.
Y schal not leeue you fadirles, Y schal come to you.
Yit a litil, and the world seeth not now me; but ye schulen se me, for Y lyue, and ye schulen lyue.
In that dai ye schulen knowe, that Y am in my fadir, and ye in me, and Y in you.
He that hath my comaundementis, and kepith hem, he it is that loueth me; and he that loueth me, schal be loued of my fadir, and Y schal loue hym, and Y schal schewe to hym my silf.
Judas seith to hym, not he of Scarioth, Lord, what is don, that thou schalt schewe thi silf to vs, and not to the world?
Jhesus answerde, and seide `to hym, If ony man loueth me, he schal kepe my word; and my fadir schal loue hym, and we schulen come to hym, and we schulen dwelle with hym.
He that loueth me not, kepith not my wordis; and the word which ye han herd, is not myn, but the fadris, that sente me.
These thingis Y haue spokun to you, dwellynge among you; but thilke Hooli Goost,
the coumfortour, whom the fadir schal sende in my name, he schal teche you alle thingis, `and schal schewe to you alle thingis, what euere thingis Y schal seie to you.
Pees Y leeue to you, my pees Y yyue to you; not as the world yyueth, Y yiue to you; be not youre herte affrayed, ne drede it.
Ye han herd, that Y seide to you, Y go, and come to you. If ye loueden me, forsothe ye schulden haue ioye, for Y go to the fadir, for the fadir is grettere than Y.
And now Y haue seid to you, bifor that it be don, that whanne it is don, ye bileuen.
Now Y schal not speke many thingis with you; for the prince of this world cometh, and hath not in me ony thing.
But that the world knowe, that Y loue the fadir; and as the fadir yaf a comaundement to me, so Y do. `Rise ye, go we hennus.
Y am a very vyne, and my fadir is an erthe tilier.
Ech braunch in me that berith not fruyt, he schal take awey it; and ech that berith fruyt, he schal purge it, that it bere the more fruyt.
Now ye ben clene, for the word that Y haue spokun to you.
Dwelle ye in me, and Y in you; as a braunche may not make fruyt of it silf, but it dwelle in the vyne, so nether ye, but ye dwelle in me.
Y am a vyne, ye the braunchis. Who that dwellith in me, and Y in hym, this berith myche fruyt, for with outen me ye moun no thing do.
If ony man dwellith not in me, he schal be caste out as a braunche, and schal wexe drie; and thei schulen gadere hym, and thei schulen caste hym in to the fier, and he brenneth.
If ye dwellen in me, and my wordis dwelle in you, what euer thing ye wolen, ye schulen axe, and it schal be don to you.
In this thing my fadir is clarified, that ye brynge forth ful myche fruyt, and that ye be maad my disciplis.
As my fadir louede me, Y haue loued you; dwelle ye in my loue.
If ye kepen my comaundementis, ye schulen dwelle in my loue; as Y haue kept the comaundementis of my fadir, and Y dwelle in his loue.
These thingis Y spak to you, that my ioye be in you, and youre ioye be fulfillid.
This is my comaundement, that ye loue togidere, as Y louede you.
No man hath more loue than this, that a man putte his lijf for hise freendis.
Ye ben my freendis if ye doen tho thingis, that Y comaunde to you.
Now Y schal not clepe you seruauntis, for the seruaunt woot not, what his lord schal do; but Y haue clepid you freendis, for alle thingis what euere Y herde of my fadir, Y haue maad knowun to you.
Ye han not chosun me, but Y chees you; and Y haue put you, that ye go, and brynge forth fruyt, and youre fruyt dwelle; that what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name, he yyue to you.
These thingis Y comaunde to you, that ye loue togidere.
If the world hatith you, wite ye, that it hadde me in hate rather than you.
If ye hadden be of the world, the world schulde loue that thing that was his; but for ye ben not of the world, but Y chees you fro the world, therfor the world hatith you.
Haue ye mynde of my word, which Y seide to you, The seruaunt is not grettere than his lord. If thei han pursued me, thei schulen pursue you also; if thei han kept my word, thei schulen kepe youre also.
But thei schulen do to you alle these thingis for my name, for thei knowen not hym that sente me.
If Y hadde not comun, and hadde not spokun to hem, thei schulden not haue synne; but now thei haue noon excusacioun of her synne.
He that hatith me, hatith also my fadir.
If Y hadde not doon werkis in hem, whiche noon other man dide, thei schulden not haue synne; but now both thei han seyn, and hatid me and my fadir.
But that the word be fulfillid, that is writun in her lawe, For thei hadden me in hate with outen cause.
But whanne the coumfortour schal come, which Y schal sende to you fro the fadir, a spirit of treuthe, which cometh of the fadir, he schal bere witnessyng of me;
and ye schulen bere witnessyng, for ye ben with me fro the bigynnyng.
These thingis Y haue spokun to you, that ye be not sclaundrid.
Thei schulen make you with outen the synagogis, but the our cometh, that ech man that sleeth you, deme that he doith seruyce to God.
And thei schulen do to you these thingis, for thei han not knowun the fadir, nether me.
But these thingis Y spak to you, that whanne the our `of hem schal come, ye haue mynde, that Y seide to you.
Y seide not to you these thingis fro the bigynnyng, for Y was with you. And now Y go to hym that sente me, and no man of you axith me, Whidur `thou goist?
but for Y haue spokun to you these thingis, heuynesse hath fulfillid youre herte.
But Y seie to you treuthe, it spedith to you, that Y go; for if Y go not forth, the coumfortour schal not come to you; but if Y go forth, Y schal sende hym to you.
And whanne he cometh, he schal repreue the world of synne, and of riytwisnesse, and of doom.
Of synne, for thei han not bileued in me;
and of riytwisnesse, for Y go to the fadir, and now ye schulen not se me;
but of doom, for the prince of this world is now demed.
Yit Y haue many thingis for to seie to you, but ye moun not bere hem now.
But whanne thilke spirit of treuthe cometh, he schal teche you al trewthe; for he schal not speke of hym silf, but what euer thinges he schal here, he schal speke; and he schal telle to you tho thingis that ben to come.
He schal clarifie me, for of myne he schal take, and schal telle to you.
Alle thingis `whiche euer the fadir hath, ben myne; therfor Y seide to you, for of myne he schal take, and schal telle to you.
A litil, and thanne ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me, for Y go to the fadir.
Therfor summe of hise disciplis seiden togidere, What is this thing that he seith to vs, A litil, and ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me, for Y go to the fadir?
Therfor thei seiden, What is this that he seith to vs, A litil? we witen not what he spekith.
And Jhesus knew, that thei wolden axe hym, and he seide to hem, Of this thing ye seken among you, for Y seide, A litil, and ye schulen not se me; and eftsoone a litil, and ye schulen se me.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to you, that ye schulen mourne and wepe, but the world schal haue ioye; and ye schulen be soreuful, but youre sorewe schal turne in to ioye.
A womman whanne sche berith child, hath heuynesse, for hir tyme is comun; but whanne sche hath borun a sone, now sche thenkith not on the peyne, for ioye, for a man is borun in to the world.
And therfor ye han now sorew, but eftsoone Y schal se you, and youre herte schal haue ioie, and no man schal take fro you youre ioie.
And in that day ye schulen not axe me ony thing; treuli, treuli, `Y seie to you, if ye axen the fadir ony thing in my name, he schal yyue to you.
`Til now ye axiden no thing in my name; `axe ye, `and ye schulen take, that youre ioie be ful.
Y haue spokun to you these thingis in prouerbis; the our cometh, whanne now Y schal not speke to you in prouerbis, but opynli of my fadir Y schal telle to you.
In that dai ye schulen axe in my name; and Y seie not to you, that Y schal preye the fadir of you;
for the fadir hym silf loueth you, for ye han loued me, and han bileued, that Y wente out fro God.
Y wente out fro the fadir, and Y cam in to the world; eftsoone Y leeue the world, and Y go to the fadir.
Hise disciplis seiden to hym, Lo! now thou spekist opynli, and thou seist no prouerbe.
Now we witen, that thou wost alle thingis; and it is not nede to thee, that ony man axe thee. In this thing we bileuen, that thou wentist out fro God.
Jhesus answeride to hem, Now ye bileuen.
Lo! the our cometh, and now it cometh, that ye be disparplid, ech in to hise owne thingis, and that ye leeue me aloone; and Y am not aloone, for the fadir is with me.
These thingis Y haue spokun to you, that ye haue pees in me; in the world ye schulen haue disese, but trust ye, Y haue ouercomun the world.
These thingis Jhesus spak, and whanne he hadde cast vp hise iyen in to heuene, he seide, Fadir, the our cometh, clarifie thi sone, that thi sone clarifie thee.
As thou hast youun to hym power on ech fleisch, that al thing that thou hast youun to hym, he yyue to hem euerlastynge lijf.
And this is euerlastynge lijf, that thei knowe thee very God aloone, and whom thou hast sent, Jhesu Crist.
Y haue clarified thee on the erthe, Y haue endid the werk, that thou hast youun to me to do.
And now, fadir, clarifie thou me at thi silf, with the clerenesse that Y hadde at thee, bifor the world was maad.
Y haue schewid thi name to tho men, whiche thou hast youun to me of the world; thei weren thine, and thou hast youun hem to me, and thei han kept thi word.
And now thei han knowun, that alle thingis that thou hast youun to me, ben of thee.
For the wordis that thou hast youun to me, Y yaf to hem; and thei han takun, and han knowun verili, that Y wente out fro thee; and thei bileueden, that thou sentist me.
Y preie for hem, Y preye not for the world, but for hem that thou hast youun to me, for thei ben thine.
And alle my thingis ben thine, and thi thingis ben myne; and Y am clarified in hem.
And now Y am not in the world, and these ben in the world, and Y come to thee. Hooli fadir, kepe hem in thi name, whiche thou yauest to me, that thei ben oon, as we ben.
While Y was with hem, Y kepte hem in thi name; thilke that thou yauest to me, Y kepte, and noon of hem perischide, but the sone of perdicioun, that the scripture be fulfillid.
But now Y come to thee, and Y speke these thingis in the world, that thei haue my ioie fulfillid in hem silf.
Y yaf to hem thi word, and the world hadde hem in hate; for thei ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
Y preye not, that thou take hem awei fro the world, but that thou kepe hem fro yuel.
They ben not of the world, as Y am not of the world.
Halewe thou hem in treuth; thi word is treuthe.
As thou sentist me in to the world, also Y sente hem `in to the world.
And Y halewe my silf for hem, that also thei ben halewid in treuthe.
And Y preye not oneli for hem, but also for hem that schulden bileue in to me bi the word of hem;
that all ben oon, as thou, fadir, in me, and Y in thee, that also thei in vs be oon; that the world bileue, that thou hast sent me.
And Y haue youun to hem the clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me, that thei ben oon,
as we ben oon; Y in hem, and thou in me, that thei be endid in to oon; and that the world knowe, that thou sentist me, and hast loued hem, as thou hast loued also me.
Fadir, thei whiche thou yauest to me, Y wole that where Y am, that thei be with me, that thei see my clerenesse, that thou hast youun to me; for thou louedist me bifor the makyng of the world.
Fadir, riytfuli the world knew thee not, but Y knew thee, and these knewen, that thou sentist me.
And Y haue maad thi name knowun to hem, and schal make knowun; that the loue bi which thou `hast loued me, be in hem, and Y in hem.
Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis, he wente out with hise disciplis ouer the strond of Cedron, where was a yerd, in to which he entride, and hise disciplis.
And Judas, that bitrayede hym, knew the place, for ofte Jhesus cam thidur with hise disciplis.
Therfor whanne Judas hadde takun a cumpany of knyytis, and mynystris of the bischopis and of the Fariseis, he cam thidur with lanternys, and brondis, and armeris.
And so Jhesus witynge alle thingis that weren to come on hym, wente forth, and seide to hem, Whom seken ye?
Thei answeriden to hym, Jhesu of Nazareth. Jhesus seith to hem, Y am. And Judas that bitraiede hym, stood with hem.
And whanne he seide to hem, Y am, thei wenten abak, and fellen doun on the erthe.
And eft he axide hem, Whom seken ye? And thei seiden, Jhesu of Nazareth.
He answeride to hem, Y seide to you, that Y am; therfor if ye seken me, suffre ye these to go awei.
That the word which he seide schulde be fulfillid, For Y loste not ony of hem, whiche thou `hast youun to me.
Therfor Symount Petre hadde a swerd, and drow it out, and smoot the seruaunt of the bischop, and kittide of his riyt eer. And the name of the seruaunt was Malcus.
Therfor Jhesus seide to Petre, Putte thou thi swerd in to thi schethe; wolt thou not, that Y drynke the cuppe, that my fadir yaf to me?
Therfor the cumpenye of knyytis, and the tribune, and the mynystris of the Jewis, token Jhesu, and bounden hym,
and ledden hym first to Annas; for he was fadir of Caifas wijf, that was bischop of that yeer.
And it was Caifas, that yaf counsel to the Jewis, that it spedith, that o man die for the puple.
But Symount Petre suede Jhesu, and another disciple; and thilke disciple was knowun to the bischop. And he entride with Jhesu, in to the halle of the bischop;
but Petre stood at the dore with outforth. Therfor `the tother disciple, that was knowun to the bischop, wente out, and seide to the womman that kepte the dore, and brouyte in Petre.
And the damysel, kepere of the dore, seide to Petre, Whether thou art also of this mannys disciplis? He seide, Y am not.
And the seruantis and mynystris stooden at the coolis, for it was coold, and thei warmyden hem; and Petre was with hem, stondynge and warmynge hym.
And the bischop axide Jhesu of hise disciplis, and of his techyng.
Jhesus answerde to hym, Y haue spokun opynli to the world; Y tauyte euermore in the synagoge, and in the temple, whider alle the Jewis camen togidere, and in hiddlis Y spak no thing.
What axist thou me? axe hem that herden, what Y haue spokun to hem; lo! thei witen, what thingis Y haue seid.
Whanne he hadde seid these thingis, oon of the mynystris stondynge niy, yaf a buffat to Jhesu, and seide, Answerist thou so to the bischop?
Jhesus answeride to hym, If Y haue spokun yuel, bere thou witnessyng of yuel; but if Y seide wel, whi smytist thou me?
And Annas sente hym boundun to Caifas, the bischop.
And Symount Petre stood, and warmyde him; and thei seiden to hym, Whether also thou art his disciple? He denyede, and seide, Y am not.
Oon of the bischops seruantis, cosyn of hym, whos eere Petre kitte of, seide, Say Y thee not in the yerd with hym?
And Petre eftsoone denyede, and anoon the cok crew.
Thanne thei ledden Jhesu to Cayfas, in to the moot halle; and it was eerli, and thei entriden not in to the moot halle, that thei schulden not be defoulid, but that thei schulden ete pask.
Therfor Pilat wente out with outforth to hem, and seide, What accusyng brynge ye ayens this man?
Thei answeriden, and seiden to hym, If this were not a mysdoere, we hadden not bitakun hym to thee.
Thanne Pilat seith to hem, Take ye hym, and deme ye him, after youre lawe. And the Jewis seiden to hym, It is not leueful to vs to sle ony man;
that the word of Jhesu schulde be fulfillid, whiche he seide, signifiynge bi what deth he schulde die.
Therfor eftsoone Pilat entride in to the moot halle, and clepide Jhesu, and seide to hym, Art thou kyng of Jewis?
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hym, Seist thou this thing of thi silf, ether othere han seid to thee of me?
Pilat answeride, Whether Y am a Jewe? Thi folc and bischops bitoken thee to me; what hast thou don?
Jhesus answeride, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my mynystris schulden stryue, that Y schulde not be takun to the Jewis; but now my kingdom is not here.
And so Pilat seide to hym, Thanne `thou art a king. Jhesus answeride, Thou seist, that Y am a king. To this thing Y am borun, and to this Y `am comun in to the world, to bere witnessing to treuthe. Eche that is of treuthe, herith my vois.
Pilat seith to hym, What is treuthe? And whanne he hadde seid this thing, eft he wente out to the Jewis, and seide to hem, Y fynde no cause in hym.
But it is a custom to you, that Y delyuere oon to you in pask; therfor wole ye that Y delyuere to you the kyng of Jewis?
Alle crieden eftsoone, and seiden, Not this, but Baraban. And Barabas was a theef.
Therfor Pilat took thanne Jhesu, and scourgide.
And kniytis writhen a coroun of thornes, and setten on his heed, and diden aboute hym a cloth of purpur,
and camen to him, and seiden, Heil, kyng of Jewis. And thei yauen to him buffatis.
Eftsoone Pilat wente out, and seide to hem, Lo! Y brynge hym out to you, that ye knowe, that Y fynde no cause in him.
And so Jhesus wente out, berynge a coroun of thornes, and a cloth of purpur. And he seith to hem, Lo! the man.
But whanne the bischopis and mynystris hadden seyn hym, thei crieden, and seiden, Crucifie, crucifie hym. Pilat seith to hem, Take ye hym, and crucifie ye, for Y fynde no cause in hym.
The Jewis answeriden to hym. We han a lawe, and bi the lawe he owith to die, for he made hym Goddis sone.
Therfor whanne Pilat hadde herd this word, he dredde the more.
And he wente in to the moot halle eftsoone, and seide to Jhesu, Of whennus art thou? But Jhesus yaf noon answere to him.
Pilat seith to him, Spekist thou not to me? Woost thou not, that Y haue power to crucifie thee, and Y haue power to delyuere thee?
Jhesus answeride, Thou schuldist not `haue ony power ayens me, but it were youun to thee from aboue; therfor he that bitook me to thee, hath the more synne.
Fro that tyme Pilat souyte to delyuere hym; but the Jewis crieden, and seiden, If thou delyuerist this man, thou art not the emperouris freend; for ech man that makith hym silf king, ayen seith the emperoure.
And Pilat, whanne he hadde herd these wordis, ledde Jhesu forth, and sat for domesman in a place, that is seid Licostratos, but in Ebrew Golgatha.
And it was pask eue, as it were the sixte our. And he seith to the Jewis, Lo! youre king.
But thei crieden, and seiden, Take awei, take awei; crucifie him. Pilat seith to hem, Schal I crucifie youre king? The bischops answeriden, We han no king but the emperour.
And thanne Pilat bitook him to hem, that he schulde be crucified. And thei token Jhesu, and ledden him out.
And he bar to hym silf a cros, and wente out in to that place, that is seid of Caluarie, in Ebreu Golgatha;
where thei crucifieden him, and othere tweyne with him, oon on this side and oon on that side, and Jhesus in the myddil.
And Pilat wroot a title, and sette on the cros; and it was writun, Jhesu of Nazareth, king of Jewis.
Therfor manye of the Jewis redden this title, for the place where Jhesus was crucified, was niy the citee, and it was writun in Ebreu, Greek, and Latyn.
Therfor the bischops of the Jewis seiden to Pilat, Nyle thou write kyng of Jewis, but for he seide, Y am king of Jewis.
Pilat answeride, That that Y haue writun, Y haue writun.
Therfor the knyytis whanne thei hadden crucified hym, token hise clothis, and maden foure partis, to ech knyyt a part, and a coot. And the coot was without seem, and wouun al aboute.
Therfor thei seiden togidere, Kitte we not it, but caste we lot, whos it is; that the scripture be fulfillid, seiynge, Thei partiden my clothis to hem, and on my cloth thei casten lot. And the kniytis diden these thingis.
But bisidis the cros of Jhesu stoden his modir, and the sistir of his modir, Marie Cleofe, and Marie Maudeleyne.
Therfor whanne Jhesu hadde seyn his modir, and the disciple stondynge, whom he louyde, he seith to hise modir, Womman, lo thi sone.
Aftyrward he seith to the disciple, Lo! thi modir. And fro that our the disciple took hir in to his modir.
Aftirward Jhesus witynge, that now alle thingis ben endid, that the scripture were fulfillid, he seith, Y thirste.
And a vessel was set ful of vynegre. And thei `leiden in isope aboute the spounge ful of vynegre, and putten to his mouth.
Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde `takun the vynegre, he seid, It is endid. And `whanne his heed was bowid doun, `he yaf vp the goost.
Therfor for it was the pask eue, that the bodies schulden not abide on the cros in the sabat, for that was a greet sabat dai, the Jewis preiden Pilat, that the hipis of hem schulden be brokun, and thei takun awei.
Therfor knyytis camen, and thei braken the thies of the firste, and of the tothere, that was crucified with hym.
But whanne thei weren comun to Jhesu, as thei sayn him deed thanne, thei braken not hise thies;
but oon of the knyytis openyde his side with a spere, and anoon blood and watir wenten out.
And he that saiy, bare witnessyng, and his witnessing is trewe; and he woot that he seith trewe thingis, that ye bileue.
And these thingis weren don, that the scripture schulde be fulfillid, Ye schulen not breke a boon of hym.
And eftsoone another scripture seith, Thei schulen se in whom thei piyten thorow.
But after these thingis Joseph of Armathi preyede Pilat, that he schulde take awei the bodi of Jhesu, for that he was a disciple of Jhesu, but priui for drede of the Jewis. And Pilat suffride. And so he cam, and took awei the bodi of Jhesu.
And Nychodeme cam also, that hadde come to hym first bi nyyt, and brouyte a meddlynge of myrre and aloes, as it were an hundrid pound.
And thei token the bodi of Jhesu, and boundun it in lynun clothis with swete smellynge oynementis, as it is custom to Jewis for to birie.
And in the place where he was crucified, was a yerd, and in the yerd a newe graue, in which yit no man was leid.
Therfor there thei putten Jhesu, for the vigilie of Jewis feeste, for the sepulcre was niy.
And in o dai of the wouke Marie Maudeleyn cam eerli to the graue, whanne it was yit derk. And sche say the stoon moued awei fro the graue.
Therfor sche ran, and cam to Symount Petre, and to another disciple, whom Jhesus louede, and seith to hem, Thei han takun the Lord fro the graue, and we witen not, where thei han leid hym.
Therfor Petre wente out, and thilke other disciple, and thei camen to the graue.
And thei tweyne runnen togidre, and thilke othere disciple ran bifor Petre, and cam first to the graue.
And whanne he stoupide, he sai the schetis liynge, netheles he entride not.
Therfor Symount Petre cam suynge hym, and he entride in to the graue, and he say the schetis leid,
and the sudarie that was on his heed, not leid with the schetis, but bi it silf wlappid in to a place.
Therfor thanne thilke disciple that cam first to the graue, entride, and sai, and bileuede.
For thei knewen not yit the scripture, that it behofte him to rise ayen fro deth.
Therfor the disciplis wenten eftsoone to hem silf.
But Marie stood at the graue with outforth wepynge. And the while sche wepte, sche bowide hir, and bihelde forth in to the graue.
And sche sai twei aungels sittinge in white, oon at the heed and oon at the feet, where the bodi of Jhesu was leid.
And thei seien to hir, Womman, what wepist thou? Sche seide to hem, For thei han take awei my lord, and Y woot not, where thei han leid him.
Whanne sche hadde seid these thingis, sche turnede bacward, and sai Jhesu stondinge, and wiste not that it was Jhesu.
Jhesus seith to hir, Womman, what wepist thou? whom sekist thou? She gessynge that he was a gardynere, seith to him, Sire, if thou hast takun him vp, seie to me, where thou hast leid him, and Y schal take hym awei.
Jhesus seith to hir, Marie. Sche `turnede, and seith to hym, Rabony, that is to seie, Maister.
Jhesus seith to hir, Nyle thou touche me, for Y haue not yit stied to my fadir; but go to my britheren, and seie to hem, Y stie to my fadir and to youre fadir, to my God and to youre God.
Marie Maudeleyne cam, tellinge to the disciplis, That Y sai the Lord, and these thingis he seide to me.
Therfor whanne it was eue in that dai, oon of the sabatis, and the yatis weren schit, where the disciplis weren gaderid, for drede of the Jewis, Jhesus cam, and stood in the myddil of the disciplis, and he seith to hem, Pees to you.
And whanne he hadde seid this, he schewide to hem hondis and side; therfor the disciplis ioieden, for the Lord was seyn.
And he seith to hem eft, Pees to you; as the fadir sente me, Y sende you.
Whanne he had seid this, he blewe on hem, and seide, Take ye the Hooli Goost;
whos synnes ye foryyuen, tho ben foryouun to hem; and whos ye withholden, tho ben withholdun.
But Thomas, oon of the twelue, that is seid Didimus, was not with hem, whanne Jhesus cam.
Therfor the othere disciplis seiden, We han seyn the Lord. And he seide to hem, But Y se in hise hondis the fitchinge of the nailis, and putte my fyngur in to the places of the nailis, and putte myn hond in to his side, Y schal not bileue.
And after eiyte daies eftsoone hise disciplis weren with ynne, and Thomas with hem. Jhesus cam, while the yatis weren schit, and stood in the myddil, and seide, Pees to you.
Afterward he seith to Thomas, Putte in here thi fyngur, and se myn hondis, and putte hidur thin hond, and putte in to my side, and nyle thou be vnbileueful, but feithful.
Thomas answeride, and seide to him, My Lord and my God.
Jhesus seith to him, Thomas, for thou hast seyn me, thou bileuedist; blessid ben thei, that seyn not, and han bileued.
And Jhesus dide many othere signes in the siyt of hise disciplis, whiche ben not writun in this book.
But these ben writun, that ye bileue, that Jhesus `is Crist, the sone of God, and that ye bileuynge haue lijf in his name.
Afterward Jhesus eftsoone schewide hym to hise disciplis, at the see of Tiberias.
And he schewide him thus. There weren togidere Symount Petre, and Thomas, that is seid Didimus, and Nathanael, that was of the Cane of Galilee, and the sones of Zebedee, and tweyne othere of hise disciplis.
Symount Petre seith to hem, Y go to fische. Thei seyn to hym, And we comen with thee. And `thei wenten out, `and wenten in to a boot. And in that niyt thei token no thing.
But whanne the morewe was comun, Jhesus stood in the brenke; netheles the disciplis knewen not, that it was Jhesus.
Therfor Jhesus seith to hem, Children, whethir ye han ony souping thing? Thei answeriden to hym, Nay. He seide to hem,
Putte ye the nett in to the riyt half of the rowing, and ye schulen fynde. And thei puttiden the nett; and thanne thei miyten not drawe it for multitude of fischis.
Therfor thilke disciple, whom Jhesus louede, seide to Petre, It is the Lord. Symount Petre, whanne he hadde herd that it is the Lord, girte hym with a coote, for he was nakid, and wente in to the see.
But the othere disciplis camen bi boot, for thei weren not fer fro the lond, but as a two hundrid cubitis, drawinge the nett of fischis.
And as thei camen doun in to the lond, thei sayn coolis liynge, and a fisch leid on, and breed.
Jhesus seith to hem, Bringe ye of the fyschis, whiche ye han takun now.
Symount Petre wente vp, and drowy the nett in to the lond, ful of grete fischis, an hundrid fifti and thre; and whanne thei weren so manye, the nett was not brokun.
Jhesus seith to hem, Come ye, ete ye. And no man of hem that saten at the mete, durste axe hym, Who art thou, witinge that it is the Lord.
And Jhesus cam, and took breed, an yaf to hem, and fisch also.
Now this thridde tyme Jhesus was schewid to hise disciplis, whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth.
And whanne thei hadde etun, Jhesus seith to Simount Petre, Symount of Joon, louest thou me more than these? He seith to him, Yhe, Lord, thou woost that Y loue thee. Jhesus seith to hym, Fede thou my lambren.
Eft he seith to hym, Symount of Joon, louest thou me? He seith to him, Yhe, Lord, thou woost that Y loue thee. He seith to him, Fede thou my lambren.
He seith to him the thridde tyme, Simount of Joon, louest thou me? Petre was heuy, for he seith to hym the thridde tyme, Louest thou me, and he seith to him, Lord, thou knowist alle thingis; thou woost that Y loue thee. Jhesus seith to hym, Fede my scheep.
Treuli, treuli, Y seie to thee, whanne thou were yongere, thou girdidist thee, and wandridist where thou woldist; but whanne thou schalt waxe eldere, thou schalt holde forth thin hondis, and another schal girde thee, and schal lede thee whidur thou wolt not.
He seide this thing, signifynge bi what deth he schulde glorifie God. And whanne he hadde seid these thingis, he seith to hym, Sue thou me.
Petre turnede, and say thilke disciple suynge, whom Jhesus louede, which also restid in the soper on his brest, and he seide to hym, Lord, who is it, that schal bitraie thee?
Therfor whanne Petre hadde seyn this, he seith to Jhesu, Lord, but what this?
Jhesus seith to him, So I wole that he dwelle til that Y come, what to thee? sue thou me.
Therfor this word wente out among the britheren, that thilke disciple dieth not. And Jhesus seide not to hym, that he dieth not, but, So Y wole that he dwelle til Y come, what to thee?
This is thilke disciple, that berith witnessyng of these thingis, and wroot hem; and we witen, that his witnessyng is trewe.
And ther ben also manye othere thingis that Jhesus dide, whiche if thei ben writun bi ech bi hym silf, Y deme that the world hym silf schal not take tho bookis, that ben to be writun.
