LICENSE

You can (and are encouraged!) to copy and distribute this

Project Gutenberg-tm etext.  Since, unlike many other of the

Project's etexts, it is copyright protected, and since the

materials and methods you use will effect the Project's

reputation,

your right to copy and distribute it is limited by the copyright

laws and by the conditions of this "Small Print!" statement.



  [A]  ALL COPIES: The Project permits you to distribute

copies of this etext electronically or on any machine readable

medium now known or hereafter discovered so long as you:



     (1)  Honor the refund and replacement provisions of this

"Small Print!" statement; and



     (2)  Pay a royalty to the Project of 20% of the net

profits you derive calculated using the method you already use

to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you don't derive

profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are payable to "Project

Gutenberg Association/Carnegie Mellon-University" within

the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were legally

required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax

return.



  [B]  EXACT AND MODIFIED COPIES: The copies you distribute

must either be exact copies of this etext, including this

Small Print statement, or can be in binary, compressed, mark-

up, or proprietary form (including any form resulting from

word processing or hypertext software), so long as *EITHER*:



     (1)  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and

does *not* contain characters other than those intended by the

author of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and

underline (_) characters may be used to convey punctuation

intended by the author, and additional characters may be used

to indicate hypertext links; OR



     (2)  The etext is readily convertible by the reader at no

expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the

program that displays the etext (as is the case, for instance,

with most word processors); OR



     (3)  You provide or agree to provide on request at no

additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in plain

ASCII.



LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES

This etext may contain a "Defect" in the form of incomplete,

inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright

or other infringement, a defective or damaged disk, computer

virus, or codes that damage or cannot be read by your

described below, the Project (and any other party you may

receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext)

disclaims all liability to you for damages, costs and

expenses, including legal fees, and YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR

NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF

WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT,

CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU

GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that

time to the person you received it from.  If you received it

on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement

copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may

choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to

receive it electronically.



THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER

WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of

implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of

consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions

may not apply to you, and you may have other legal rights.



INDEMNITY

You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,

officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost

and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or

indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
