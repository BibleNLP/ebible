The Literal Standard Version of the Holy Bible is a registered copyright of Covanet Press and the Covenant Christian Coalition (© 2020). Covenant Press is soliciting partnerships with Bible publishers that are interested in the LSV project. For queries about partnering with us, please email the translation team at covenantpress@ccc.one. To learn more, visit lsvbible.com. The purpose behind the LSV is to provide readers with a modern, easy-to-read, literal, and accurate translation of the Bible that is free to read, distribute, and translate from. We pray that God will use the LSV to illuminate the hearts and minds of multitudes with the good news that His Son Jesus Christ came in the flesh, died for our sins as a substitutionary sacrifice, rose bodily from the dead, and is coming back again.</p>
